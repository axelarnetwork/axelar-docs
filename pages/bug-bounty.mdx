# Bug bounty

There are two ways to disclose security vulnerabilities to the Axelar team:

1. Submit a report to our <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/axelarnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">Immunefi bug bounty program</a>.
2. Send email to `security@axelar.network` describing the vulnerability.

Even if your security vulnerability is not eligible for a bounty from the bug bounty program (option 1) the Axelar team might decide to award a bounty for a security vulnerability submitted by email to `security@axelar.network` (option 2).

## Vulnerability Criteria

Most vulnerabilities that are found automatically using widely-available tools (e.g. improper domain configuration) are out of scope for Axelar's bug bounty program (option 1 above). Axelar may decide to award bounty up to USD $100 for a vulnerability of this form submitted to `security@axelar.network` (option 2 above).

Often, such a vulnerability does not require the submitter to produce a detailed report. Instead, the initial submission should be only a short note describing the issue. If a more detailed report is needed then Axelar will reply with a request.
