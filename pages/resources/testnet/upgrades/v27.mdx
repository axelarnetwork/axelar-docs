# Testnet-1 upgrade: v0.27

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Instructions for `2022-Nov-16` testnet upgrade to axelar-core `v0.27.0`, vald `v0.27.0`, and tofnd `v0.10.1`.
Release can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/releases/tag/v0.27.0).

Upgrade height `4868740` [countdown](https://testnet.mintscan.io/axelar-testnet/blocks/4868740)

1. If you're a validator or have delegated to one, please vote for the upgrade proposal via

```bash
axelard tx gov vote 31 yes --from validator
```

2. Wait for the proposed upgrade block, `4868740`. Your node will panic at that block height with a log: `{"level":"error","module":"consensus","err":"UPGRADE \"v0.27\" NEEDED at height: ",`. Stop your node after chain halt.

```bash
pkill -f 'axelard start'
# Validators need to also stop vald/tofnd
pkill -f 'vald-start'
pkill -f tofnd
```

3. Backup the state:

```bash
cp -r ~/.axelar_testnet/.core/data ~/.axelar-lisbon-3-upgrade-0.27/.core/data
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Caution: If you backup the entire folder, `~/.axelar_testnet/.core`, that'll also include your private keys (inside `config` and `keyring-file` subfolders). That can be dangerous if anyone gets access to your backups. We recommend backing up keys separately when you first create your node, and then excluding them from any data backups.
</Callout>

4. Restart your `axelard` node with the new `v0.27.0` build.
5. If you're a validator also restart `vald` with `v0.27.0` and `tofnd` with `v0.10.1`.

Example using join scripts in [axelarate-community git repo](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community):

```bash
# in axelarate-community repo
git checkout main
git pull
KEYRING_PASSWORD="pw-1" ./scripts/node.sh -n testnet -a v0.27.0
# For validators, restart vald/tofnd
KEYRING_PASSWORD="pw-1" TOFND_PASSWORD="pw-2" ./scripts/validator-tools-host.sh -n testnet -a v0.27.0 -q v0.10.1
```
