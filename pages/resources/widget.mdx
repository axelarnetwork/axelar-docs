## Overview of functions

### Start the Testnet

Seeing the widget for the first time will show you a Testnet that isn't running yet:

![widget](/images/start_testnet.png)

Clicking the `Start Testnet` button will start your Testnet. This will take around 2-3 minutes:

The Testnets you create with this widget will only run for 2 hours. If you'd like to create longer-running Testnets, [sign up with Harbor](https://live.goharbor.com).

### Restart the Testnet

Once a Testnet has successfully started, the `Start Testnet` button will be replaced by a `Restart Testnet` button.

![widget](/images/restarted_testnet.png)

Click it to restart the Testnet. You should restart the Testnet if you'd like to update your Testnet configuration or recover from an issue.

During the restart process, the chains and actor instances will restart as well. All previous transactions in the chain would be nullified, while the state of the actor would also be restarted.

### Download smart contract ABIs

Under the chain section, click on the three dots of a smart contract cell, then click `Download ABI` to download its ABI.
