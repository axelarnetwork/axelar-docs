# Monitoring state of GMP transactions

Axelar provides two options to check each GMP transaction status: 
1. The Axelarscan UI. 
2. The [AxelarJS SDK](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/tx-status-query-recovery).

## 1. Axelarscan UI
Anyone can view a General Message Passing transaction on the GMP page of the Axelarscan block explorer: [Mainnet](https://axelarscan.io/gmp) | [Testnet](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/gmp).

To search for a particular transfer, enter a transaction hash or a sender address in the search bar.

Once you navigate to the detailed transfer page, you will see four main statuses with an additional status, as displayed in the image below.

- **CONTRACT CALL** provides the contract call (`callContract` or `callContractWithToken`) information, including the transaction hash, the block height on the source chain, the gateway address, etc.
- **GAS PAID** displays the gas prepaid to Axelar Gas Receiver contract.
- **CALL APPROVED** displays the information on the call approval. This section will be updated once the Axelar network approves the call. 
- **EXECUTED** informs the execution result whether the execution is successful or not. If it's unsuccessful, there will be an [error message](/dev/gmp/gmp-tracker-recovery/error-debugging) with the cause of the error, displayed in this section. 
- **GAS REFUNDED** provides the refund information (if any), including the amount of gas paid, the amount of gas used, the refund amount, etc. This information will appear only when thereâ€™s a refund.


## 2. AxelarJS SDK

See the SDK docs section, [Query transaction status by txHash](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/tx-status-query-recovery#query-transaction-status-by-txhash).
