# Get a deposit address

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

A deposit address is a special address created and monitored by **Axelar's Relayer Services** on behalf of the requester. It is similar to how centralized exchanges generate a monitored, one-time deposit address that facilitates your token transfers.

### Deposit address workflow

1. The user generates a deposit address on a specific source chain.
2. The user sends tokens to the deposit address on the source chain.

- Examples:

  - withdrawal from a centralized exchange
  - transaction from your favorite wallet software.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
IMPORTANT NOTE: When making your deposit, please ensure that the amount is **greater than the cross-chain relayer gas fee**
- A table of fees is listed here: [mainnet](../../resources/mainnet#cross-chain-relayer-gas-fee) | [testnet](../../resources/testnet#cross-chain-relayer-gas-fee).
- Alternatively, they can be programmatically queried in the SDK's [AxelarQueryAPI](../axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#gettransferfee).
</Callout>



3. Axelar relayers observe the deposit transaction on the source chain and complete it on the destination chain, assuming the amount exceeds the requisite fee.
4. Watch your tokens arrive on the destination chain.

### 1. Prerequisite

To help you write clean code, you can use the `Environment` and `CHAINS` constants.

Most methods in the sdk require you to work with chain ids instead of chain names. **Chain ids are unique per Environment** and are _specific to Axelar_. For instance, Ethereum will have a chain id of `ethereum` on mainnet but `ethereum-2` on testnet. In the same way Osmosis will be `osmosis` on mainnet but `osmosis-4` on tesnet. However some chains will have no difference between the chain names and chain ids.

To find the chain ids we support you can check the resources section. You can find the **testnet chain information** [here](/resources/testnet) and **mainnet chain information** [there](/resources/mainnet)

### 2. Install the AxelarJs SDK

The AxelarJS SDK is an `npm` dependency that helps to make requests to the Axelar network. The SDK is essentially a wrapper around various API endpoints. One of the endpoints allows you to generate a deposit address. Alternately, you can create a deposit address using the [CLI instead of the SDK](../../learn/cli).

```bash
npm i @axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk
# or
yarn add @axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk
```

### 3. Import & instantiate the `AxelarAssetTransfer`

```ts
import { AxelarAssetTransfer, Environment } from "@axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk";

const axelarAssetTransfer = new AxelarAssetTransfer({
  environment: Environment.TESTNET,
});
```

### 4. Get an estimate of the transfer fees (optional)

If you plan on using the transfer assets functionality, it is paramount to take the relayer fees into account. Any deposits into a deposit address that are not in excess of this calculate fee will not get processed until that deposit address is topped up to encompass the fee.

The following query retrieves the fee charged by the relayer for a transfer.

```ts
import {
  AxelarQueryAPI,
  CHAINS,
  Environment,
} from "@axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk";

async function main() {
  const axelarQuery = new AxelarQueryAPI({
    environment: Environment.TESTNET,
  });

  const fee = await axelarQuery.getTransferFee(
    CHAINS.TESTNET.OSMOSIS,
    CHAINS.TESTNET.AVALANCHE,
    "uausdc",
    1000000
  );
  // returns  { fee: { denom: 'uausdc', amount: '150000' } }
}

main();
```

### 5. Generate a deposit address using the SDK

Call `getDepositAddress`:

```tsx
async getDepositAddress(
  fromChain: string, // source chain
  toChain: string, // destination chain
  destinationAddress: string, // destination address to transfer the token to
  asset: string, // denom of asset. See note (2) below
  options?: {
    _traceId: string;
  }
): Promise<string> {}
```

Example: Cosmos to EVM (Osmosis to Avalanche):

```tsx
const sdk = new AxelarAssetTransfer({
  environment: "testnet"
});
const depositAddress = await sdk.getDepositAddress(
  "osmosis", // source chain
  "avalanche", // destination chain
  "0xF16DfB26e1FEc993E085092563ECFAEaDa7eD7fD", // destination address
  "uausdc" // denom of asset. See note (2) below
);
```

Example: EVM to Cosmos (Avalanche to Osmosis):

```tsx
const sdk = new AxelarAssetTransfer({
  environment: "testnet",
  auth: "local",
});
const depositAddress = await sdk.getDepositAddress(
  "avalanche", // source chain
  "osmosis", // destination chain
  "osmo1x3z2vepjd7fhe30epncxjrk0lehq7xdqe8ltsn", // destination address
  "uausdc" // denom of asset. See note (2) below
);
```

Notes: 

(1) The destination address format is validated based on the destination chain. Make sure the destination address is a valid address on the destination chain. For instance, Osmosis addresses begin with “osmo,” etc.

Once the deposit address has been generated, the user can make a token transfer (on blockchain) to the deposit address. The transfer will be picked up by the Axelar network and relayed to the destination chain.

(2) For all the assets that Axelar supports natively, the network identifies the asset by a `denom`. If you are accustomed to the `symbol` typically used on EVM chains, you will have to convert that `symbol` to a `denom`. The SDK has an API method you can use to convert symbol to denom: [getDenomFromSymbol](./axelar-query-api#getdenomfromsymbol)
