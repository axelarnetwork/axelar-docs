# Example: Airdrop! (an end-to-end walkthrough)

Watch Axelar engineers demo an end-to-end walkthrough of our Airdrop example, which sends axlUSDC from a source chain to a list of recipients on a destination chain using the callContractWithToken function. The full-stack example includes running the examples locally, deploying to testnet, and reviewing analytics tools in testnet ... all run with a simple bootstrapped front end.
