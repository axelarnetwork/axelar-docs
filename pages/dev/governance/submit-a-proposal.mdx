## Submit a Governance Proposal

### Steps to creating your Axelar Community Governance Proposal

1. Create a proposal on the [Community Grants section](https://community.axelar.network/c/governance2/33) of Axelar’s Governance Forum, which should include (where applicable) the following [information](https://community.axelar.network/t/about-the-community-grants-program/2271).


2. The Governance Forum will remain open to the community for a temperature check to ask questions, gauge sentiment and for the proposer to make any edits to the proposal for `7 days` after posting. During this time, please engage with all community questions and feedback, and be prepared to amend the proposal where necessary.

3. Once the `7 days` window has passed, you can submit the Proposal for an on-chain governance vote:

### Prerequisite

- An account named ***validator*** with at least **2000AXL** balance
- If there is no such account with sufficient fund, please follow steps below

```bash
# create an account validator
$ axelard keys add validator 

# display key address 
$ axelard keys list

# send fund to this validator account
$ axelard tx bank send [account_with_fund_address] [validator_key_address] 2000000000uaxl
```

### Submit Proposal CMD

```bash
$ axelard tx gov submit-proposal community-pool-spend <file> --from validator --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.2
```

`<file>` →  JSON file with following format

```bash
{
    "title": "<title>",
    "description": "<description>",
		"amount": "<amount_in_uaxl>", # 20000000000uaxl = 20000AXL
		"recipient": "<fund_recipient_address>",
		"deposit": "2000000000uaxl"
}
```

- **Voting:** proposals are voted on by all token holders. Validators can vote on behalf of the token holders if they abstain from participating, however the token holder’s vote overwrites their validator’s vote for their amount of stake. 

- **Remittance:** upon passing the vote, funds will be sent the Axelar wallet associated with the successful proposal, funded via Axelar’s on-chain community pool.
