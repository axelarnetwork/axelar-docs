# Community Grants Proposals

Axelar has a [community pool](https://www.mintscan.io/axelar/community-pool) of funds to support community projects that benefit developers and users of Axelar. Axelar uses decentralized governance to provide these funds. Create a governance proposal on-chain which can be voted upon. If there is a successful resolution of the proposal, the funds will automatically be provided.

## Applying for a community grant
We ask teams to create an application on our [community forum](https://community.axelar.network/c/governance2/33) before submitting any on-chain proposals to provide additional information and background about your proposal.

1. Create an application on the [Community Grants section](https://community.axelar.network/c/governance2/33) of Axelar’s Governance Forum, which should include the following [information](https://community.axelar.network/t/about-the-community-grants-program/2271).

2. The Governance Forum will remain open to the community for a temperature check to ask questions, gauge sentiment and for the proposer to make any edits to the proposal for **7 days** after posting. During this time, please engage with all community questions and feedback, and be prepared to amend the proposal where necessary.

3. Once the feedback window has passed, you can submit the Proposal for an on-chain governance vote.

## On-chain governance proposal
Once a Governance Forum proposal has been live for the required temperature check and the feedback window has closed, you can submit an on-chain proposal to be voted on. Governance proposals are submitted on-chain using `axelard` (the [Axelar CLI](/learn/cli)) and a local Axelar node.

### Prerequisites

* You must have [axelard](/node/config-node#download-binaries-and-initialize-configuration)
* You must have a local Axelar node running
* You must have an account named `validator` with at least **2000AXL** balance


### Create a validator account
```bash
# create an account validator
$ axelard keys add validator 
# enter passphrase

# display key address 
$ axelard keys list

# send funds from an existing wallet to this validator account
$ axelard tx bank send [account_with_fund_address] [validator_key_address] 2000000000uaxl
```

### Submit a Proposal
Now that you have a wallet named `validator` with 2000AXL, you can submit a proposal on-chain.

```bash
$ axelard tx gov submit-proposal community-pool-spend <file> --from validator --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.2
```

`<file>` → JSON file with following format

```json
{
    "title": "<title>",
    "description": "This proposal withdraw funds from community pool for <purpose> as mentioned here:\n<link>",
		"amount": "<amount_in_uaxl>", # 20000000000uaxl = 20000AXL
		"recipient": "<fund_recipient_address>",
		"deposit": "2000000000uaxl"
}
```

* **Voting:** proposals are voted on by all token holders. Validators can vote on behalf of the token holders if they abstain from participating, however the token holder’s vote overwrites their validator’s vote for their amount of stake. 
* **Remittance:** upon passing the vote, funds will be sent the Axelar wallet associated with the successful proposal, funded via Axelar’s on-chain community pool.

## FAQ

**Who can submit a proposal?**

Anyone from Axelar’s community can submit a proposal for consideration. Proposals require a 2,000 AXL deposit.

**What’s the purpose of a community proposal?**

Community proposals are meant to decentralize the governance process on Axelar, create the opportunity for AXL holders, stakers and the larger Axelar ecosystem to propose incentives they would like to see funded.
