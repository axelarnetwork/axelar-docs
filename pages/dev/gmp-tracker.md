### Manually execute a transfer
Axelar provides a relayer service that automatically executes transfers for you. Alternatively, in some cases where you don't want to wait for the auto-relayer, you can manually execute a transfer through the Axelarscan's GMP page by connecting a wallet and clicking the Execute button. Please note that you need to pay gas to process the transaction.
