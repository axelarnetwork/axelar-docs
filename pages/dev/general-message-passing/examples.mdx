#  Example cross-chain dApps using GMP

The [axelar-examples](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples/) repo has an array of examples to show the ease of integrating Axelar's GMP protocol into any dApp to bring it cross-chain. The examples range in use cases and complexity but ultimately leverage the two fundamental building blocks for GMP:
- `callContract`
- `callContractWithToken`

## "Hello World!"

Say hello to your first dApp on Axelar. The dApp sends a message -- "Hello World" -- from a source to a destination chain using the `callContract` function.

## Airdrop

Send axlUSDC from a source chain to a list of recipients on a destination chain using the `callContractWithToken` function. Each recipient will receive an equal portion of the total tokens sent.

Watch Axelar engineers demo an end-to-end walkthrough of our Airdrop example, which sends axlUSDC from a source chain to a list of recipients on a destination chain using the callContractWithToken function. The full-stack example includes running the examples locally, deploying to testnet, and reviewing analytics tools in testnet ... all run with a simple bootstrapped front end.

## Mint tokens and send cross-chain

Mints some amount of ERC-20 tokens at a source chain and sends it using the `callContract` function to a destination chain. Tokens are burned on the source-chain contract and minted on the destination-chain contract.

## NFT linker

Send an NFT on a source chain to a recipient on a destination chain using the `callContract` function. If the source chain is where the NFT was originally created, the NFT gets locked in the contract and minted on the destination chain; in the reverse direction, the NFT is burned and transferred to its final recipient on the destination (/original home) chain.

## Two-way example: send back

A two-way example using `callContract` in both directions where a message is sent from a source chain to a destination chain, and an "executed" acknowledgement is sent back to the source chain.
