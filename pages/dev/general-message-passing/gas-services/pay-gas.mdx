## Overview 
Axelar gas services provide methods to pay the relayer gas fee for both `callContract` and `callContractWithToken`. The fee can be paid in the native token of the source chain or any token supported by Axelar network. An application that wants Axelar to automatically execute contract calls on the destination chain needs to do three things:

1. Estimate the `gasLimit` that the contract call will require on your executable contract on the destination chain.

2. Call the `estimateGasFee` method to get the `sourceGasFee` in the desired gas-payment token on the destination chain. See this [code snippet](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#estimategasfee) for reference. (As a prerequisite, Axelar SDK must be installed. Refer to [AxelarJS SDK](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/intro).)

3. Pay the AxelarGasService smart contract on the source chain in the amount calculated in step 2.

## Example
For example, assume the following smart contract is deployed on a source chain:

```solidity
contract SimpleTransferContract {
  ...
  function sendToMany(
      string memory destinationChain,
      string memory destinationContractAddress,
      address[] calldata destinationAddresses,
      string memory symbol,
      uint256 amount
  ) external payable {
      address tokenAddress = gateway.tokenAddresses(symbol);
      IERC20(tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
      IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(address(gateway), amount);
      bytes memory payload = abi.encode(destinationAddresses);

      if(msg.value > 0) {
          // The line below is where we pay the gas fee
          gasReceiver.payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken{value: msg.value}(
              address(this),
              destinationChain,
              destinationContractAddress,
              payload,
              symbol,
              amount,
              msg.sender
          );
      }
      gateway.callContractWithToken(destinationChain, destinationContractAddress, payload, symbol, amount);
  }
}
```

The `msg.value` is the gas amount we pay to the `AxelarGasService` contract.

So, on the front-end side, we need to pass `sourceGasFee` to `msg.value` like below:

```ts
await contract.sendToMany("moonbeam", "0x...", ["0x.."], "USDC", 1, {
  value: sourceGasFee, // This is the value we get from Step 2.
});
```

After sending a transaction out, our Executor Service will do the following:

- Monitor `AxelarGasReceiver` for receipt of payment, and get the amount paid as `amountPaid`.
- Match those to contract calls.
- Execute the specified contract call, specifying the `gasLimit` defined above.

## Alternative gas payment methods for `callContract`
You can pay gas for relaying `callContract` using the following method.

### payNativeGasForContractCall
This method accepts the native tokens of the source chain.

```solidity
// This is called on the source chain before calling the gateway to execute a remote contract.
function payNativeGasForContractCall(
    address sender,
    string calldata destinationChain,
    string calldata destinationAddress,
    bytes calldata payload,
    address refundAddress
) external payable;
```

## Alternative gas payment methods for `callContractWithToken`
Similar to the available gas payment methods for `callContract`, there are two available methods to pay gas for relaying the `callContractWithToken`.

### payGasForContractCallWithToken
This method receives any tokens for the relayer fee. The paid gas for this method must be in tokens Axelar supports. See the list of supported assets: [Mainnet](../../reference/mainnet-contract-addresses) | [Testnet](../../reference/testnet-contract-addresses).

```solidity
// This is called on the source chain before calling the gateway to execute a remote contract.
function payGasForContractCallWithToken(
    address sender,
    string calldata destinationChain,
    string calldata destinationAddress,
    bytes calldata payload,
    string calldata symbol,
    uint256 amount,
    address gasToken,
    uint256 gasFeeAmount,
    address refundAddress
) external;
```

### payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken
This method accepts the native tokens of the source chain.

```solidity
// This is called on the source chain before calling the gateway to execute a remote contract.
function payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken(
    address sender,
    string calldata destinationChain,
    string calldata destinationAddress,
    bytes calldata payload,
    string calldata symbol,
    uint256 amount,
    address refundAddress
) external payable;
```

### Methods arguments description
The function names are prety self-explanatory. The following is true for the arguments:

- For all functions:
  - `sender` needs to match the address that calls `callContract` or `callContractWithToken` on the `AxelarGateway`. If the `AxelarGasReceiver` is called by the same contract that will call the Gateway, then simply specify `address(this)` as `sender`.
- For `payGasForContractCall` and `payNativeGasForContractCall`, the following need to match the arguments of a `contractCall` on the `AxelarGateway`:
  - `destinationChain`
  - `destinationAddress`
  - `payload`
- For `payGasForContractCallWtihToken` and `payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken`, the following need to match the arguments of a `contractCallWithToken` on the `AxelarGateway`:
  - `destinationChain`
  - `destinationAddress`
  - `payload`
  - `symbol`
  - `amount`
- For `payGasForContractCall` and `payGasForContractCallWtihToken`:
  - `gasToken` is the address of the token that gas will be paid in. Ensure this token is supported by the network, using the Axelar API.
  - `gasFeeAmount` is the amount of `gasToken` to transfer from the sender. The sender needs to have approved the `AxelarGasReceiver` with the appropriate amount to `gasToken` first.
- For `payNativeGasForContractCall` and `payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken`, the amount of funds received is specified by `msg.value`.
- For all functions, `refundAddress` is the address that will eventually be able to receive excess amount paid for gas.

## Two-way call
The Executor Service supports relaying two-way calls.

A two-way call refers to the scenario of sending a message from a source chain and immediately executing it at a destination chain. Finally, return another message call to the source chain.


```
Outbound call: a GMP call from chain A to chain B
Returned call: a GMP call returned from chain B to chain A
```

Once an outbound call is executed on chain B and sends another call to return a message to chain A, the Executor service automatically forwards the remaining gas to relay the returned trip.

Suppose the remaining gas amount is insufficient for the returned trip, the `Insufficient Fee` tag will show up on Axelarscan UI (see [Monitoring state of GMP transactions](/dev/general-message-passing/monitoring)). In that case, the returned call won't be relayed until the gas is added. You can increase more gas to relay the call to the destination contract via the [Axelar SDK](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/tx-status-query-recovery#2-increase-gas-payment) or [Axelarscan UI](/dev/general-message-passing/recovery#increase-gas-payment-to-the-gas-receiver-on-the-source-chain).

## Sending messages to multiple destination chains from a single transaction
The Executor Service also supports relaying multiple message calls from a transaction. To do so, the application must pay gas to the Gas Receiver separately for each message. Please see the below message call as an example.
