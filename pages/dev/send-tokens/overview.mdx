# Send tokens cross-chain

There are three ways to transfer tokens cross-chain with Axelar:

1. Call `sendToken` from any source chain.
1. Get a deposit address using the [AxelarJS SDK](../axelarjs-sdk/token-transfer-dep-addr).
1. For tokens not [natively supported](/dev/reference/mainnet-contract-addresses#assets), build your own [Interchain Token](interchain-tokens).

## Call `sendToken`

`sendToken` is an API method that allows you to send any token supported directly on the Axelar network to any recipient on a destination chain. 

The underlying mechanics work slightly differently, depending on whether the origin chain is an EVM chain or a Cosmos-based chain:

### `sendToken` from an EVM Source Chain

1. Locate the Axelar Gateway contract on the source chain.
2. Execute approve on the source chain (ERC-20).
3. Execute sendToken on the Gateway.

#### 1. Locate the Axelar Gateway contract on the source chain

Axelar Gateways are application-layer smart contracts established on source and destination chains. They send and receive payloads, and monitor state. Find a list of Gateway addresses for the chains we support: [Mainnet](../reference/mainnet-contract-addresses) | [Testnet](../reference/testnet-contract-addresses).

An Axelar Gateway implements the `IAxelarGateway` interface, which has a public method called `sendToken`:

```solidity
function sendToken(
    string memory destinationChain,
    string memory destinationAddress,
    string memory symbol,
    uint256 amount
) external;
```

#### 2. Execute approve on the source chain (ERC-20)

Transferring tokens through a Gateway is similar to an ERC-20 token transfer. You first need to approve the Gateway to transfer a specific token in a specific amount. This approval is done via the `approve` method of the ERC-20 interface:

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```

Here, `spender` is the Gateway address on the source chain.

Find a list of assets, their names and their addresses: [Mainnet](../reference/mainnet-contract-addresses) | [Testnet](../reference/testnet-contract-addresses). Note that for the same asset denom, the ERC20 symbol could be different on different chains (e.g. `USDC` on Ethereum is linked to `axlUSDC` on Avalanche).

#### 3. Execute sendToken on the Gateway

Call `sendToken` on the Gateway contract of the source chain. Example:

```solidity
sendToken(
    "avalanche", // destination chain name
    "0xF16DfB26e1FEc993E085092563ECFAEaDa7eD7fD", // some destination wallet address (should be your own)
    "axlUSDC", // asset symbol, can be differ by chain, see above
    100000000 // amount (in atomic units)
)
```

Watch for the tokens to appear at the destination address on the destination chain.

### `sendToken` from a Cosmos-based Source Chain

From any Cosmos-based source chain, `sendToken` is a simple IBC transfer of any asset supported on the Axelar network where the message:
* is sent to the designated admin address on Axelar for receiving GMP (General-Message-Passing) messages -  `axelar1dv4u5k73pzqrxlzujxg3qp8kvc3pje7jtdvu72npnt5zhq05ejcsn5qme5`
* includes a `memo` field with the following payload:

```typescript
    {
      destination_chain,
      destination_address,
      payload: null,
      type: 3, // corresponds to the `sendToken` command on Axelar
    }
```

### Using AxelarJS SDK for `sendToken`

In `v0.13.0`+ Axelar's JS SDK abstracts the invocations above in a one-line JS code that can be called directly from any frontend dApp. Example implementations below:

#### Example: Invoking `sendToken` using the JS SDK from an EVM chain

```typescript
import { AxelarAssetTransfer, CHAINS, Environment, SendTokenParams } from "@axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk";
import { ethers, Wallet } from "ethers";

const api = new AxelarAssetTransfer({ environment: Environment.TESTNET });

const getSigner = () => {
  const privateKey = PRIVATE_KEY;
  return new Wallet(privateKey);
};

async function test() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc"
  );
  const signer = getSigner().connect(provider);
  const requestOptions: SendTokenParams = {
    fromChain: CHAINS.TESTNET.AVALANCHE,
    toChain: CHAINS.TESTNET.OSMOSIS,
    destinationAddress: "osmo1x3z2vepjd7fhe30epncxjrk0lehq7xdqe8ltsn",
    asset: { symbol: "aUSDC" },
    amountInAtomicUnits: "5000000",
    options: {
      evmSendTokenOptions: {
        signer,
        provider,
        txOptions: null as any,
        approveSendForMe: true,
      },
    },
  };
  return api.sendToken(requestOptions);
}
```

#### Example: Invoking `sendToken` using the JS SDK from a Cosmos-based chain

```typescript

import { AxelarAssetTransfer, CHAINS, Environment, SendTokenParams } from "@axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk";
import { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing";

const api = new AxelarAssetTransfer({ environment: Environment.TESTNET });

const getSigner = async () => {
  const mnemonic = MNEMONIC;
  return DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic, { prefix: "osmo" });
};

async function test() {
  const offlineSigner = await getSigner();
  const requestOptions: SendTokenParams = {
    fromChain: CHAINS.TESTNET.OSMOSIS,
    toChain: CHAINS.TESTNET.AVALANCHE,
    destinationAddress: "0xB8Cd93C83A974649D76B1c19f311f639e62272BC",
    asset: { denom: "ibc/6F34E1BD664C36CE49ACC28E60D62559A5F96C4F9A6CCE4FC5A67B2852E24CFE" }, //aUSDC
    amountInAtomicUnits: "1000000",
    options: {
      cosmosSendTokenOptions: {
        cosmosDirectSigner: offlineSigner,
        rpcUrl: "https://rpc.osmotest5.osmosis.zone",
        fee: {
            gas: "250000",
            amount: [{ denom: "uosmo", amount: "30000" }],
        },
      },
    },
  };
  return api.sendToken(requestOptions);
}
```

## Get a deposit address
Use a deposit address if:

- You need functionality not offered by `sendToken`. Example: Cosmos-to-X.
- You want to allow token transfers from wallets that don't know anything about Axelar. Example: Withdrawal from a centralized exchange.


You'll find the SDK method to `getDepositAddress` as a part of the [AxelarJS SDK](../axelarjs-sdk/token-transfer-dep-addr).
