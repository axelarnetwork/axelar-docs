# Axelar Pricing

Transactions using Axelar often have a source chain, Axelar, and destination chains costs associated with them. To simplify this, Axelar has two general solutions to this problem. The first, for asset transfers, is to take a portion of the assets being transferred. The second is to use a chain-agnostic gas relaying service where gas is paid in the native source chain currency.

## `sendToken` and `getDepositAddress` (token transfers) 
Prices are fixed based on the source chain, destination chain, and address. You can query these directly on the Axelar network.

Whether you are transferring 10 axlUSDC or 10,000,000 axlUSDC, the cost is the same.

Asset transfers were designed this way to give users a `one click` experience. Users aren't required to submit multiple blockchain transactions approving payments in addition to the transactions for sending the tokens.

## callContract (General Message Passing)
Every transaction is made up of 3 types of costs, all of which are paid in a single transaction in the chain's native currency. All costs can be seen on [Axelarscan](https://axelarscan.io) by looking at a specific transaction, [from Moonbeam to BNB Chain for example](https://axelarscan.io/gmp/0x598d35609919bc6c0737ae229af56b2135ccf5c1b031e1bd8d45f4ec4190e5a4:65).

Costs are charged in the source chain's native currency, and are based on current conversion rates for the gas used by Axelar and the destination chain.


1. **Base Fee** - The base fee for any transaction is fixed based on the chains involved, but covers three components of the transaction
    * Validator confirmation voting on the Axelar Network
    * Relaying of approval on the destination chain
    * Costs related to delivering any possible refund on the destination chain
1. **Execution Fee** - The execution fee is variable depending on the chains involved, and the complexity of your `_execute` method.


## callContractWithToken
Fees for `callContractWithToken` are almost identical to those of `callContract`, but have an increased execution cost due to the additional gas cost of minting/releasing tokens.

## callContractWithTokenExpress
Fees for GMP express include all of the same fees as `callContractWithToken`, plus an additional fee to cover relayer risk.

## Interchain Tokens
Under the hood, creating an [Interchain Token](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens) uses `callContract``, so users are responsible for the gas on the source chain to register the token, plus the addition of a `callContract` to each destination chain where the token is being registered.
