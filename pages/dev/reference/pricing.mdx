# Axelar Pricing

Transactions using Axelar often have a source chain, Axelar, and destination chains costs associated with them. To simplify this, Axelar has two general solutions to this problem. The first, for asset transfers, is to take a portion of the assets being transferred. The second is to use a chain-agnostic gas relaying service where gas is paid on the source chain in its native currency.

## Token transfers via `sendToken` or `getDepositAddress`
Prices are fixed based on the source chain, destination chain, and asset. You can query these directly on the Axelar network to refer to the `Resources` tab under the `Cross-chain relayer gas fee` section. 

Whether you are transferring 10 axlUSDC or 10,000,000 axlUSDC, the cost is the same. The amount sent in a transaction must exceed the cost of the fee; it otherwise remains in the queue until the aggregate amount exceeds the fee.

Asset transfers were designed this way to give users a `one click` experience. This simplified UX makes it so that users are not required to submit multiple blockchain transactions approving payments in addition to the transactions for sending the tokens.

## callContract (General Message Passing)
Every cross-chain transaction transaction is made up of 3 types of costs, due to:
1. initiating the transaction on the source chain,
2. processing the transaction through the Axelar blockchain, and
3. relaying to the gateway contract on the destination chain + executing the final transaction on the destination smart contract

All costs can be seen on [Axelarscan](https://axelarscan.io) by looking at a specific transaction, [from Moonbeam to BNB Chain for example](https://axelarscan.io/gmp/0x598d35609919bc6c0737ae229af56b2135ccf5c1b031e1bd8d45f4ec4190e5a4:65).

Axelar's gas services allow the user/dApp to pay all of these costs in a single transaction on the source chain in its native currency. The cost is based on current conversion rates for the gas used by Axelar and the destination chain.

1. **Base Fee** - The base fee for any transaction is fixed based on the chains involved, but covers three components of the transaction
    * Validator confirmation voting on the Axelar Network
    * Relaying of approval on the destination chain
    * Costs related to delivering any possible refund on the destination chain
1. **Execution Fee** - The execution fee is variable depending on the chains involved, and the complexity of your `_execute` method.

The `estimateGasFee` method in the [AxelarQueryAPI](../axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#estimategasfee) calculates this total cost for you.

### Special Considerations
**Volatility of gas prices** - 

**Round trip transactions (two-way calls)** - 

## callContractWithToken (General Message Passing)
Fees for `callContractWithToken` are almost identical to those of `callContract`, but have an increased execution cost due to the additional gas cost of minting/releasing tokens.

## callContractWithTokenExpress
Fees for GMP express include all of the same fees as `callContractWithToken`, plus an additional fee to cover relayer risk.

## Interchain Tokens
Under the hood, creating an [Interchain Token](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens) uses `callContract``, so users are responsible for the gas on the source chain to register the token, plus the addition of a `callContract` to each destination chain where the token is being registered.
