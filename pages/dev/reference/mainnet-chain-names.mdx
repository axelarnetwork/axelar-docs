# Chain names: Mainnet

The following values are legal arguments for token transfers and General Message Passing calls such as `callContract` and `callContractWithToken`.

The contract call approval at the Axelar gateway and contracts inheriting `AxelarExecutable` contracts will receive precisely these values from the source chain.

Note these names are case-sensitive.
