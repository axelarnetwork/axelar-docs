Instructions to set up your Base (Coinbase L2) node.

## Requirements

- [Setup your Axelar validator](/validator/setup)
- Minimum hardware requirements: 16GB RAM, 100GB+ free storage space.
- MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 (tested on 20.04)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.base.org/guides/run-a-base-node)
- [Base GitHub](https://github.com/base-org/node)


## Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq -y
snap install docker
```

## Configure and start node

1. Clone the Base repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/base-org/node
```

2. In `.env.*`, set `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC` to your own Ethereum L1 RPC node. Using your own Ethereum node is required to guarantee decentralization and security for validation.

3. In `docker-compose.yml`, uncomment the right `.env.*` depending on whether you're syncing mainnet or goerli testnet.

4. When pointing to your own Ethereum RPC node, you can enable `OP_NODE_L1_TRUST_RPC=true` in the config for fast sync and allow Erigon support.

5. Run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

6. You should now be able to `curl` your Base node:

```bash
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

You can check the latest block against the [explorer](https://basescan.org/) to determine sync status.

Since Base uses the Optimism stack, you can review the [Optimism Instructions](/validator/external-chains/optimism) for more details on expected log output and helpful rpc queries.

### Configure vald

In order for `vald` to connect to your Base node, your Base RPC should be exposed in
vald's `config.toml`
