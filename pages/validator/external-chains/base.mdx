Instructions to set up your Base (Coinbase L2) node.

## Requirements

- [Setup your Axelar validator](/validator/setup)
- Minimum hardware requirements: 16GB RAM, 100GB+ free storage space.
- MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 (tested on 20.04)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.base.org/guides/run-a-base-node)
- [Base GitHub](https://github.com/base-org/node)


## Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq -y
snap install docker
```

## Configure and start node

1. Clone the Base repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/base-org/node
```

2. In `docker-compose.yml`, set `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC` to your own Ethereum L1 RPC node. Using your own Ethereum node is required to guarantee decentralization and security for validation.

3. When pointing to your own Ethereum RPC node, you can enable `OP_NODE_L1_TRUST_RPC=true` in the config for fast sync and allow Erigon support.

4. Run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

5. You should now be able to `curl` your Base node:

```bash
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

Sync speed depends on your L1 node, as the majority of the chain is derived from data submitted to the L1. You can check your syncing status using the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC on the `op-node` container. Example:

```bash
echo Latest synced block behind by: \
$((($( date +%s )-\
$( curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545 |
   jq -r .result.unsafe_l2.timestamp))/60)) minutes
```

You can check the latest block against the [explorer](https://basescan.org/).

Since Base uses the Optimism stack, you can review the [Optimism Instructions](/validator/external-chains/optimism) for more details on expected log output and helpful rpc queries.

### Configure vald

In order for `vald` to connect to your Base node, your Base RPC should be exposed in
vald's `config.toml`
