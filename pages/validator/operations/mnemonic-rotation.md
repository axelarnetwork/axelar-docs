# Rotation of mnemonics in tofnd

Starting from `axelard` `v0.17.1` and `tofnd` `v0.10.0`, validators can use `tofnd -m rotate` to generate a new mnemonic and slowly rotate out their old mnemonics for better security practices. New Axelar key rotations will automatically use the most recent mnemonic generated by `tofnd -m rotate`.

Validators need to keep their old `tofnd` mnemonics until all keys generated from those mnemonics are considered "old" by the Axelar network. A key becomes _old_ after `x` subsequent key rotations. (Currently `x=7`.)

```bash
# Kill vald/tofnd processes
pkill -f "vald"
pkill -f "tofnd"

# Rotate tofnd mnemonic
tofnd -m rotate -d ~/.axelar/.tofnd

# Note: Keep the old mnemonic backups around

# BACKUP the new exported mnemonic and then DELETE the local copy
mv $TOFND_HOME/export ..
rm $TOFND_HOME/export

# Restart vald/tofnd processes
```

## Recovery of mnmenonics

As always, you can import a `tofnd` mnemonic with `tofnd -m import`. If there are no other mnemonics yet in `tofnd` storage then the imported mnemonic will be automatically used for future key rotations. Each subsequent imported mnemonic will not be automatically used for future key rotations.
