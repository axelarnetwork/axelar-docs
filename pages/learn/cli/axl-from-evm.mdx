Redeem AXL tokens from an EVM chain to Axelar using the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Skill level: intermediate
- Prerequisites for [Send AXL to an EVM chain](./axl-to-evm)

## Redeem AXL tokens from an EVM chain

Link your Axelar `my_account` account to a new temporary deposit address on the EVM chain:

```bash
axelard tx evm link {EVM_CHAIN} axelarnet {MY_ADDR} uaxl --from my_account
```

Output should contain

```
successfully linked {EVM_TEMP_ADDR} and {MY_ADDR}
```

Optional: query your new `{EVM_TEMP_ADDR}`:

```bash
axelard q nexus latest-deposit-address {EVM_CHAIN} axelarnet {MY_ADDR}
```

Use Metamask to send some wrapped AXL tokens on `{EVM_CHAIN}` to the new temporary deposit address `{EVM_TEMP_ADDR}`. Save the transaction hash `{EVM_TX_HASH}` for later.

<Callout type="error" emoji="🔥">
  Danger: Send only `Axelar` ERC20 tokens to `{EVM_TEMP_ADDR}`. Any other token sent to `{EVM_TEMP_ADDR}` will be lost.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="📝">
  Note: Third-party monitoring tools will automatically complete the remaining steps of this process.

Wait a few minutes then check your Axelar `my_account` account AXL token balance as per [Basic node management](/node/basic).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Caution: If you attempt the remaining steps while third-party monitoring tools are active then your commands are likely to conflict with third-party commands. In this case you are likely to observe errors. Deeper investigation might be needed to resolve conflicts and complete the transfer.

The remaining steps are needed only if there are no active third-party monitoring tools and you wish to complete the process manually.
</Callout>

Do not proceed to the next step until you have waited for sufficiently many block confirmations on the EVM chain. Block confirmation minimums can be found at [Testnet resources](/resources/testnet), [Mainnet resources](/resources/mainnet).

Confirm the EVM chain transaction on Axelar.

```bash
axelard tx evm confirm-erc20-deposit {EVM_CHAIN} {EVM_TX_HASH} {AMOUNT} {EVM_TEMP_ADDR} --from my_account
```

Wait for confirmation on Axelar.

Optional: Search the axelar-core logs for confirmation:

```bash
tail -f $AXELARD_HOME/logs/axelard.log | grep -a -e "deposit confirmation"
```

Create and sign pending transfers for `{EVM_CHAIN}`.

```bash
axelard tx evm create-burn-tokens {EVM_CHAIN} --from my_address
axelard tx evm sign-commands {EVM_CHAIN} --from my_address
```

Output should contain

```
successfully started signing batched commands with ID {BATCH_ID}
```

Get the `execute_data`:

```bash
axelard q evm batched-commands {EVM_CHAIN} {BATCH_ID}
```

Wait for `status: BATCHED_COMMANDS_STATUS_SIGNED` and copy the `execute_data`.

Use Metamask to send a transaction on `{EVM_CHAIN}` with the `execute_data` to the Axelar gateway contract address `{GATEWAY_ADDR}`.

<Callout type="error" emoji="🔥">
  Danger: Post your transaction to the correct chain! Set your Metamask network to `{EVM_CHAIN}`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Caution: Manually increase the gas limit to 5 million gas (5000000). If you don't do this then the transaction will fail due to insufficient gas and you will not receive your tokens.

Before you click "confirm": select "EDIT", change "Gas Limit" to 5000000, and "Save"
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Tip: Learn the Axelar `{GATEWAY_ADDR}` for `{EVM_CHAIN}` in two ways:

### 1. Documentation

[Testnet resources](/resources/testnet), [Mainnet resources](/resources/mainnet).

### 2. Terminal

```bash
axelard q evm gateway-address {EVM_CHAIN}
```

</Callout>

To send a transaction to `{GATEWAY_ADDR}` using Metamask: paste hex from `execute_data` above into "Hex Data" field. (Do not send tokens!)

Optional: Check your Axelar `my_account` account AXL token balance as per [Basic node management](/node/basic) so that you can observe balance change.

Execute the pending transfer:

```bash
axelard tx axelarnet execute-pending-transfers --from my_account
```

You should see the redeemed `{AMOUNT}` of AXL token (minus transaction fees) in your Axelar `my_account` account.

Congratulations! You have redeemed AXL tokens from the external EVM chain back to Axelar!
