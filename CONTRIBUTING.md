### How to Contribute

1. Before you submit your Pull Request (PR), search the project for an open or closed PR related to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the repository within your user and clone it to your local machine.
3. Install the dependencies for the project as indicated in the README.md
4. Create a new branch for your contribution with the following command:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch
   ```

5. Make your changes in the new git branch
6. Commit your changes. Your commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

   ```shell
   git commit -a
   ```

   Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files. Push your branch to GitHub with the following command:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

   Open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.

If we suggest changes then:

- Make the required updates and commit them to your branch.
- Wait for the project maintainer to review your changes and merge your Pull Request.

> If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue.

When you open a new issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem and the expected behavior. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
