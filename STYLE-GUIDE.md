# Axelar Developer Documentation Style Guide

Thank you for contributing to the Axelar documentation! We aim to provide clear, consistent information on how to build for the interchain future. Please refer to this guide when working on the docs. It will be updated regularly as Axelar grows and new standards come into place.

This style guide is inspired by the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

## Table of contents

* [Voice and tone](#voice-and-tone)
* [Document structure](#document-structure)
* [Content format](#content-format)
* [Wording](#wording)

## Voice and tone

* Be friendly, respectful, and not overly pedantic, like you're pair-programming with a friend.
* Refer to [Google's word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) when unsure how to phrase something.

### When addressing the reader

* Address the reader directly by using the second-person "you."
* Do not use the word "I." When speaking on Axelar's behalf (as a member of the Axelar team), use "we."
* Avoid using “we” to refer to Axelar as a project. Refer to Axelar by name or as “the project,” “the community,” “the ecosystem,” etc.

### When referring to a third party user or developer

* Use the singular "they" when referring to a third party user or developer.

| **Recommended**                                    | **Not recommended**                                     |

| A user can check their transactions on Axelarscan. | A user can check his or her transactions on Axelarscan. |

### Accessibility

* Use "earlier", "preceding", or "following" to refer to the position of a code snippet or UI element in a document rather than "above," "below," or "left-hand side."

| **Recommended**                                                              | **Not recommended**                                                      |

| Copy the address from the preceding section.                                 | Copy the address from the section above.                                 |

## Document structure

* Avoid a wall of text whenever possible.
* Break a long section up into subsections with the appropriate headings.
* Add screenshots when a UI is not likely to change.

### Code comments

* Comment in the code directly whenever possible.
* Add bullet points directly above or below the code snippet if it makes the code more clear.

**Recommended**

`sendToMany` will need to do the following:

* Get the address of a token from its symbol
* Send funds to another address
* Approve the gateway to spend funds
* Encode the recipient addresses on the destination chain to ensure that they are `byte`s, since GMP messages must be of this type

```solidity
function sendToMany(
  string memory _destChain,
  string memory _destContractAddr,
  address[] calldata _destinationAddrs,
  string memory _symbol,
  uint256 _amount
) external payable {
    // Check that funds have been sent. If no
    // funds have been sent, revert the transaction.
    require(msg.value > 0, "Gas payment required");

    // Use the gateway contract to obtain the address
    // of the ERC-20 token you will be sending from
    // chain A to chain B.
    address tokenAddress = gateway.tokenAddresses(_symbol);

    // Transfer the ERC-20 token from the sender's
    // wallet to this contract.
    IERC20(tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

    // Grant approval to the gateway contract to
    // transfer funds on this contract's behalf.
    IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(address(gateway), _amount);

    // Encode and send a GMP message along with the
    // token. _destinationAddrs is a list that contains
    // the addresses of the ERC-2O token's final
    // recipients once the transaction has arrived
    // at the destination chain.
    bytes memory recipientAddressesEncoded = abi.encode(_destinationAddrs);

    // Output: a list of addresses in bytes
}
```

**Not recommended**

`sendToMany` will need to get the address of a token from its symbol, send funds to another address, approve the gateway to spend funds, and encode the recipient addresses on the destination chain to ensure that they are `bytes`, since GMP messages must be of this type. It will have a list of `bytes` as output.

```solidity
function sendToMany(
string memory \_destChain,
string memory \_destContractAddr,
address[] calldata \_destinationAddrs,
string memory \_symbol,
uint256 \_amount
) external payable {

    require(msg.value > 0, "Gas payment required");

    address tokenAddress = gateway.tokenAddresses(_symbol);

    IERC20(tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

    IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(address(gateway), _amount);

    bytes memory recipientAddressesEncoded = abi.encode(_destinationAddrs);

}
```

### Section headings

* Don't skip heading types. A subheading under a title should be an H1, the nested subheading under that one an H2, and so forth.

### Document titles

* For **H1 headings** (headings with one "#" sign in front), use [title case](https://titlecaseconverter.com/) for all words longer than 3 characters.

|  Everything you Always Wanted to Know About Headings, but Were Afraid to Ask  |  Everything you always wanted to know about headings, but were afraid to ask  |

* For **H2 headings and below** (headings with two or more "#" signs in front), write in [sentence case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case) rather than capitalizing every letter of a new word.

|  **Recommended**  |  **Not recommended** |

* Always use numerical numbers in all headings.

* Never close a heading with a period. Exclamation points and question marks are OK.

## Content format

* Use bold, italic, and code font when appropriate.
* Product names should not have any special font formatting.
* Always put parentheses after a method name.

## Method names

* Method names should always include parentheses, so that they are not confused with properties.

### Lists

* When writing a list, either use complete sentences for all elements or no elements. Either every element has a period at the end, or none of them do. Do not mix and match.

**Recommended**

Implement the following to send an interchain transaction with Axelar:

* `AxelarExecutable` – The contract to handle a message on the destination chain once a transaction has been sent to the Axelar network
* `IAxelarGateway` – The Axelar Gateway
* `IAxelarGasService` – The Axelar Gas Service
* `IERC20` – The ERC-20 token interface to access ERC-20-related functionality

**Not recommended**

Implement the following to send an interchain transaction with Axelar:

* `AxelarExecutable` – This is a contract that handle a message on the destination chain once a transaction has been sent to the Axelar network.
* `IAxelarGateway` – The Axelar Gateway
* `IAxelarGasService` – The Axelar Gas Service
* `IERC20` – This represents the ERC-20 token interface to access ERC-20-related functionality.

## Wording

* **General Message Passing**: Capitalize, since it is as a product name – “Axelar General Message Passing,” "GMP," or “Axelar GMP” (never "Axelar’s GMP"). If you’re looking for a generic description, use “arbitrary message passing.”
* **Interchain**: Wherever possible, use “interchain,” instead of “cross-chain,” “blockchain interoperability,” “chain-agnostic” or other synonyms. "Interchain" is only capitalized at the beginning of a sentence.
* **Interchain Tokens**: title case. Likewise Interchain Token Service, Interchain Token Portal, Canonical Interchain Token.
* **Network**: “Axelar network,” not “Axelar Network.”
* **Proof-of-stake**: Only capitalize the first word in titles and at the beginning of sentences. Always hyphenate.
* **Web**, **Web2**, **Web3**: Capitalized everywhere, as in “the decentralized Web,” “the Web,” and any other context referring to the World Wide Web. “Web2” and “Web3” are also capitalized and written as one word.
* **Mint/Burn**, not **mint/burn**.
* **Lock/Unlock**, not **lock/unlock**.
* **Token manager** is not a proper noun, unless specifying the `TokenManager` object (in which case it should be code font).
* Refer to Axelar's Gas Service as **Axelar Gas Service**, **the Gas Service**, or **the `AxelarGasService` contract**, not as "Gas Services" or "the `GasService` contract."
* Time format is always in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
