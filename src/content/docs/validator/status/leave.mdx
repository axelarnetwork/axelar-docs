# Leave the network as a validator

{/* [TODO revise. 2 metrics: consensus bonded/active and tss bonded/active.] */}

1. Deactivate your broadcaster account.

```bash
axelard tx snapshot deactivate-proxy --from validator -y -b block
```

{/* 2. Wait until the next key rotation for the changes to take place.  In this release, we're triggering key rotation about once a day. So come back in 24 hours, and continue to the next step. If you still get an error after 24 hours, reach out to a team member. */}
2. Query your network‚Äôs key‚Äêrotation window and (optionally) opt out of future rotations.

- Fetch the multisig module parameters and note the `activeEpochCount`
```bash
axelard query multisig params
```

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    Note: Fetching the `activeEpochCount` ensures you know exactly how many rotation cycles you must wait before none of your keys remain active
</Callout>


3. Wait for your keys to fully rotate out.

- Key rotation runs roughly once per day. You must wait activeEpochCount full rotations (e.g. 5 days by default) after deactivating your proxy (and/or after opt-out) before no of your keys remain in the edge contract‚Äôs active list. Only then can you safely unbond

4. Release your staked coins.

```bash
axelard tx staking unbond [axelarvaloper address] [amount]uaxl --from validator -y -b block
```

eg:

```bash
axelard tx staking unbond "$(axelard keys show validator --bech val -a)" 100000000uaxl --from validator -y -b block
```

`amount` refers to how many coins you wish to remove from the stake. You can change the amount.

To preserve network stability, the staked coins are held for roughly 1 day starting from the unbond request before being unlocked and returned to the `validator` account.
