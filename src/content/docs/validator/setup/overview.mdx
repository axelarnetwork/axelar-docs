# Overview

import { Callout } from "/src/components/callout";

An Axelar network validator participates in block creation, multi-party cryptography protocols, and voting.

Convert your existing Axelar node into a validator by staking AXL tokens and attaching external EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** Minimum: 16 cores, 16GB RAM, 1.5 TB drive. Recommended: 32 cores, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB+ drive.
- You have downloaded the Axelar blockchain and are comfortable with [Basic node management](/node/basic/).

MOVE:

- Your Axelar node has an account named `validator` that you control. Let `{VALIDATOR_ADDR}` denote the address of your `validator` account.
- Backup your `validator` secret mnemonic and your Tendermint consensus secret key as per [Quick sync](/node/join).

## Steps to become a validator

1. [Configure companion processes](/validator/setup/config/)
2. [Create and backup accounts](/validator/setup/backup/)
3. [Launch companion processes](/validator/setup/vald-tofnd/)
4. [Register broadcaster proxy](/validator/setup/register-broadcaster/)
5. [Stake AXL tokens on the Axelar network](/resources/tokens/stake-axl/)
6. [Health check](/validator/status/health-check/)
7. [Set up external chains](/validator/external-chains/overview/)

## Other setup-related tasks

- [Recover validator from mnemonic or secret keys](/validator/setup/manual/#generate-keys)
- [Leave as a validator](/validator/status/leave/)
