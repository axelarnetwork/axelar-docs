# Common Amplifier Error Messages

import { Callout } from "/src/components/callout";

The following are some common error messages encountered when working with verifiers and relayers on the Amplifier.

<Callout type="error">
  These errors may be caused by other issues. The reasons given are based off of
  known causes only.
</Callout>

## Verifiers

- `command not found: axelard` — The symlink or alias to `axelard` is not working. Use full binary name instead for commands, such as `./axelard` version instead of `axelard version`. Alternatively you can fix your alias, `PATH`, or symlink.

- `command not found: tofnd` — The symlink or alias to `tofnd` is not working. Use full binary name instead for commands, such as `tofnd-darwin-[version] --help` instead of `tofnd --help`. Alternatively you can fix your alias, `PATH`, or symlink.

- `connection failed: transport error` — `ampd` can't connect to `tofnd`. Make sure that you have tofnd running in the background and that the port and hots `tofnd` is listening on match the information in your `ampd` config file.

- **axelard cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified** (Mac) — Disable the gatekeeper for a single binary with `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/ampd-darwin-arm64-v1.2.0`, or disable gatekeeper globally with `sudo spctl --master-disable`.

- `error trying to connect: received corrupt message` — Your RPC server may not support HTTPS. Try HTTP instead.

- `error trying to connect: invalid dnsname` — Your IP-addressed server may not support HTTPS. Use `http://` instead.

## Message relayers

- `Generic error: Querier contract error: codespace` — The message that was supposed to be routed can’t be found. Search for `unfit_for_routing` in your terminal output to see if the message was actually routed. The transaction will succeed even with unsuccessful routing.

- `message index: 0` — There are no new messages to confirm.
