# XRPL

Node setup guide for your XRP Ledger Testnet or Mainnet validator.

## Requirements

- [Set up your Amplifier verifier node](https://docs.axelar.dev/validator/amplifier/verifier-onboarding/)
- Recommended hardware requirements:
    * CPU: 3+ GHz 64-bit x86_64 processor with 8+ cores
    * Memory: 64 GB RAM
    * Disk: 1 TB SSD/NVMe
- Ubuntu Linux 18.04+ (tested on 22.04) or Debian 10+
- [Official Documentation](https://xrpl.org/docs/infrastructure/installation)

## Install on Ubuntu or Debian Linux

1. Update repositories:

```bash
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates wget gnupg
```

2. Add Ripple's package-signing GPG key to your list of trusted keys:

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings && \
    wget -qO- https://repos.ripple.com/repos/api/gpg/key/public | \
    sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/ripple.gpg
```

3. Check the fingerprint of the newly-added key:

```bash
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/keyrings/ripple.gpg
```

The output should include an entry for Ripple such as the following:

```
pub   rsa3072 2019-02-14 [SC] [expires: 2026-02-17]
    C0010EC205B35A3310DC90DE395F97FFCCAFD9A2
uid           TechOps Team at Ripple <techops+rippled@ripple.com>
sub   rsa3072 2019-02-14 [E] [expires: 2026-02-17]
```

4. Add the appropriate Ripple repository for your operating system version. Replace `$OS` with:
- `buster` for Debian 10 Buster
- `bullseye` for Debian 11 Bullseye
- `bookworm` for Debian 12 Bookworm
- `bionic` for Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver
- `jammy` for Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish
- `noble` for Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/ripple.gpg] https://repos.ripple.com/repos/rippled-deb $OS stable" | \
    sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ripple.list
```

5. Update the package index to include Ripple's repo and install `rippled`.

```bash
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y install rippled
```

6. Configure your node to store at least a month of ledger history. Edit your `rippled.cfg` file located at `/etc/opt/ripple/rippled.cfg`:
- Under the `[node_db]` stanza, update `online_delete` (keep the rest of the parameters as is):
```
[node_db]
online_delete=750000
```
- Uncomment and set the `[ledger_history]` stanza:
```
[ledger_history]
750000
```

7. Configure the `[server]` stanza in `rippled.cfg` securely according to your needs.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Note: The default `[server]` parameters may allow for unauthorized administrative access to your node.
</Callout>

8. Restart the `rippled` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rippled.service
```

9. Check the status of the `rippled` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status rippled.service
```

If you're configuring a Mainnet `rippled` node, you can skip the next section.

## Just for Testnet

If you are setting up a Testnet `rippled` node, first complete the above proccess, and then follow these next steps:

### 1. Hub configuration

Edit your `rippled.cfg` file located under `/etc/opt/ripple/rippled.cfg`.

1. Set an `[ips]` stanza with the Testnet hub:

```
[ips]
s.altnet.rippletest.net 51235
```

2. Comment out the previous `[ips]` stanza, if there is one.

3. Add a `[network_id]` stanza with the appropriate value:

```
[network_id]
testnet
```

### 2. Trusted validator configuration

Edit your `validators.txt` file located under `/etc/opt/ripple/validators.txt`.

1. Uncomment or add the Testnet `[validator_list_sites]` and `[validator_list_keys]` stanzas:

```
[validator_list_sites]
https://vl.altnet.rippletest.net

[validator_list_keys]
ED264807102805220DA0F312E71FC2C69E1552C9C5790F6C25E3729DEB573D5860
```

2. Comment out any previous `[validator_list_sites]`, `[validator_list_keys]`, or `[validators]` stanzas.

### 3. Restart the server

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rippled
```

You can find more information on connecting to parallel networks [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/infrastructure/configuration/connect-your-rippled-to-the-xrp-test-net).

## Final checks

Use the `rippled` commandline interface to see if your server is synced with the network:

```bash
rippled server_info
```

It can take several minutes to sync. When the `server_state` in the response is `full`, then your server is fully synced with the network.

You can query the node with:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"method":"server_info","params":[{}]}' http://localhost:5005
```

## Axelar Node Configuration

Due to a bug in the Cosmos SDK that appears when the database is being read from under heavy load, when `ampd` is trying to broadcast transactions, your Axelar node may run into issues when running (such as an `AppHash` error). An example of such an error may appear as follows:

`ERR CONSENSUS FAILURE!!! err="precommit step; +2/3 prevoted for an invalid block: wrong Block.Header.AppHash`

Your node orchestration needs to be updated to perform a `rollback` when a node crashes. The rollback command must be executed **before restarting the Axelar node** to auto-recover from such errors. The rollback can be performed by running:

```bash
axelard rollback
```


### Ampd Configuration
Once your node is up and running, you need to add the `XRPL` chain to your [ampd daemon's](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/tree/main/ampd) `config.toml`file. This can be done by adding in the following configuration:

<tabs>
  <tab-item title="Mainnet">
    ```toml
    [[handlers]]
    type="XRPLMsgVerifier"
    chain_name="xrpl"
    chain_rpc_url="your_own_rpc"
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar14rd4uyrqyl0tw75gjn8zqfppmy08t3x3wrsujeqp37l0hghduanscfvkz6"
    
    [[handlers]]
    type="XRPLMultisigSigner"
    chain_name="xrpl"
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5"
    ```
  </tab-item>
  <tab-item title="Testnet">
    ```toml
    [[handlers]]
    type="XRPLMsgVerifier"
    chain_name="xrpl"
    chain_rpc_url="your_own_rpc"
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar1pnynr6wnmchutkv6490mdqqxkz54fnrtmq8krqhvglhsqhmu7wzsnc86sy"

    [[handlers]]
    type="XRPLMultisigSigner"
    chain_name="xrpl"
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5"
    ```
  </tab-item>
</tabs>

  Mainnet config instructions will be added when XRPL is integrated on mainnet.
</Callout>

### Register Chain 
For your node to be recognized by the Axelar network, you need to register your chain with the `ampd` daemon. This can be done by running:  

```bash
ampd register-chain-support amplifier xrpl
```
