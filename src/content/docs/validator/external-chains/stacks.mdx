Instructions to set up your Stacks node.

## Prerequisites

- [Setup your Axelar validator](/validator/setup/overview/)
- [Minimum hardware requirements](https://docs.stacks.co/guides-and-tutorials/nodes-and-miners/run-a-node-with-docker#requirements):
  - Memory: 8 GB RAM
  - CPU: 2 CPU cores
  - Disk: 500 GB NVMe SSD storage
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.stacks.co/guides-and-tutorials/nodes-and-miners/run-a-node-with-docker)

## Setup Stacks Node

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain-docker
cd stacks-blockchain-docker
```

Open `manage.sh` script

```bash
nano +6 manage.sh
```

Add the following function to support the newer docker compose syntax

```bash
docker-compose() {
    docker compose "$@"
}
```

**Note:**  This ensures compatibility with newer Docker versions where docker compose replaces the legacy docker-compose.

Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x manage.sh
```

### Start the services

<tabs>
  <tab-item title="Mainnet">
  ```bash
  ./manage.sh -n mainnet -a start
  ```
  </tab-item>
  <tab-item title="Testnet">
  ```bash
  ./manage.sh -n testnet -a start
  ```
  </tab-item>
</tabs>

### Setup Bitcoin Node

As Stacks is a Bitcoin layer 2, you will also need to run a Bitcoin node to query the layer 1 state. You can setup the Bitcoin node by going through the following [setup instructions](https://docs.stacks.co/guides-and-tutorials/nodes-and-miners/run-a-bitcoin-node).

### Check Logs

<tabs>
  <tab-item title="Mainnet">
  ```bash
  ./manage.sh -n mainnet -a logs
  ```
  </tab-item>
  <tab-item title="Testnet">
  ```bash
  ./manage.sh -n testnet -a logs
  ```
  </tab-item>
</tabs>

After a few minutes, you should see lines that look like this. This means your node has started syncing with the network and is receiving blocks.

```

### Check the following ports to check the block height

Stacks Blockchain port:

```bash
curl -sL localhost:20443/v2/info | jq -r
```

Stacks Blockchain Api service port: 

```bash
curl -sL localhost:3999 | jq -r
```

## Ampd Configuration

Once your node is up and running, you need to add the `stacks` chain to your [ampd daemon's](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/tree/main/ampd) `config.toml`file. This can be done by adding in the following configuration:

<tabs>
    <tab-item title="mainnet">
    ```toml
      TBA
    ```
    </tab-item>
    <tab-item title="testnet">
    ```toml
      TBA
    ```
    </tab-item>
</tabs>

## Chain Registration

For your node to be recognized by the Axelar Network, you need to register your verifier's support for the chain with the `ampd` daemon. This can be done by running:  

```bash
ampd register-chain-support amplifier stacks
```
