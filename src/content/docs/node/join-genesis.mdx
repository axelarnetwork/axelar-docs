Start your Axelar node and download the blockchain from scratch.

  Tip: These instructions synchronize your Axelar node from scratch using the
  Axelar peer-to-peer network. You can synchronize your node more quickly by
  downloading a recent snapshot of the blockchain as per [Quick
  sync](/node/join/).

## Prerequisites

- [CLI configuration](/node/config-cli/).
- Ensure AXELARD_HOME variable is set in your current session. See https://docs.axelar.dev/node/config-node#home-directory (example AXELARD_HOME="$HOME/.axelar").

## Follow the upgrade path

Configure your system as per [Node configuration](/node/config-node/) except specify the correct version of `axelard` according to your network and position in the upgrade path:

<tabs>
<tab-item title="Mainnet">

 <UpgradePath />

</tab-item>
<tab-item title="Testnet">

 <UpgradePathTestnet />
 
</tab-item>
</tabs>

First, you have to change directory to "axelarate-community" repository.

```bash
cd axelarate-community
```

To run setup-node.sh you have to specify the network (mainnet, testnet) and the axelard core version you want to use.
You must follow the upgrade path as specified in the table above (it is different for each network).
setup-node.sh will download axelard binary version you specified in "$AXELARD_HOME/bin" folder and create a symbolic link.

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x  1 kalid  staff  70832530 Jul  6 11:04 axelard-v0.13.6
lrwxr-xr-x  1 kalid  staff        48 Jul  6 11:04 axelard -> /Users/kalid/.axelar_testnet/bin/axelard-v0.13.6
```
<br/>
<tabs>
<tab-item title="Mainnet">
```bash
./scripts/setup-node.sh -n mainnet -a v0.10.7
```
</tab-item>
<tab-item title="Testnet">
```bash
./scripts/setup-node.sh -n testnet -a v0.13.6
```
</tab-item>

</tabs>

Start your node with the newly configured `axelard` version:

```bash
$AXELARD_HOME/bin/axelard start --home $AXELARD_HOME >> $AXELARD_HOME/logs/axelard.log 2>&1 &
```

Your Axelar node will resume downloading the blockchain.

After your blockchain has reached `UPGRADE_HEIGHT` you will see a panic in the logs like

```
panic: UPGRADE {NAME} NEEDED at height: {UPGRADE_HEIGHT}:
```

## View your logs in real time

```bash
tail -f $AXELARD_HOME/logs/axelard.log
```

Repeat this process for each entry in the upgrade path when the "panic" message appears in the logs.
