# Soroban Contracts

The core contracts for Axelar's integration with Stellar Soroban can be found at the [axelar-cgp-soroban](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-soroban) repository. 

The Rust based GMP contracts can be thought of similarly to their [EVM](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-messages/) counterparts. 

At the core of there are two main contracts involved in sending a GMP message, these are the [Gateway Contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-soroban/tree/main/contracts/axelar-gateway) and the [Gas Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-soroban/tree/main/contracts/axelar-gas-service).

## Soroban Gateway
The Gateway facilitates sending and receiving of cross-chain messages to other chains via the Axelar Network.

For sending a GMP message, the `callContract()` function needs to be triggered.

### CallContract
The `callContract` function triggers your cross-chain message from Stellar to the Axelar Network. When sending a cross-chain message you must specify the destination of your cross-chain message and a given payload.
    
The `callContract` function takes five parameters. 
1. `env`: Standard soroban [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `caller`: (optional) The sender of the contract call. Inferred as.... ******** TODO REVIEW*************************
1. `destination_chain`: Name of the chain the message is being sent to.
1. `destination_address`: Address on the destination chain the message is being sent to.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

```rust
pub fn call_contract(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
){}
```

## Soroban Gas Service
The Gas Service handles cross-chain gas payment when making a GMP request. 

When sending a GMP message before triggering the `call_contract()` function on the Gateway, the `pay_gas_for_contract_call()` must be triggered first to pay for the cross-chain transaction.  

### PayGasForContractCall()
 The `pay_gas_for_contract_call()` allows users to pay for the entirety of the cross-chain transaction in a given token. 

 The `pay_gas_for_contract_call()` takes seven parameters.
1. `env`: Standard soroban [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `sender`: (optional) The sender of the gas payment call. 
1. `destination_chain`: Name of the chain the message is being sent to.
1. `destination_address`: Address on the destination chain the message is being sent to.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.
1. `refund_address`: An address to be refunded if gas amount was overpaid.
1. `token`: The token being used for payment

Note: The expected [token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-soroban/blob/main/packages/axelar-soroban-std/src/types.rs#L5) is a struct type that requires an `address` and `amount`. 

```rust
pub fn pay_gas_for_contract_call(
    env: Env,
    sender: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
    refund_address: Address,
    token: Token,
) -> Result<(), ContractError> {}
```

## Soroban Executable
The [Executable](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-soroban/blob/main/contracts/axelar-gateway/src/executable.rs#L9) is a Rust Trait (not an individual contract) that will be used to execute a cross-chain call on a Soroban dapp when Stellar is the receiving chain of a cross-chain message.

### Execute 
The `execute()` function will be triggered by an Axelar relayer when the cross-chain message arrives. Your contract should implement the `execute()` function to handle the incoming cross-chain GMP data.

The `execute()` function takes five parameters.
1. `env`: Standard soroban [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `source_chain`: The source chain where the gmp message is coming from.
1. `message_id`: Identifier for incoming GMP message.
1. `source_address`: The address on the source chain where the gmp message is coming from/
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

```rust
fn execute(
    env: Env,
    source_chain: String,
    message_id: String,
    source_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
);
```

### Validate & Validate Message
The `validate()` function on the `Executable` will trigger the `validate_message()` that is [defined](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-soroban/blob/main/contracts/axelar-gateway/src/contract.rs#L128) on the `Gateway`.

The `validate()` function takes five parameters.
1. `env`: Standard soroban [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `source_chain`: The source chain where the gmp message is coming from.
1. `message_id`: Identifier for incoming GMP message.
1. `source_address`: The address on the source chain where the gmp message is coming from/
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

```rust
    fn validate(
        env: Env,
        source_chain: String,
        message_id: String,
        source_address: String,
        payload: Bytes,
    ) {}
```

The `validate()` function will trigger the `validate_message()`, this will confirm that the incoming GMP message is an authenticated message that has been verified by the Amplifier Verifiers.

```rust
     pub fn validate_message(
        env: Env,
        caller: Address,
        source_chain: String,
        message_id: String,
        source_address: String,
        payload_hash: BytesN<32>,
    ) -> bool {}
```

1. `env`: Standard soroban [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `caller`: (optional) The sender of the contract call. 
1. `source_chain`: The source chain where the gmp message is coming from.
1. `message_id`: Identifier for incoming GMP message.
1. `source_address`: The address on the source chain where the gmp message is coming from/
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

Returns a `bool` indicating whether the incoming GMP message is valid or not.
