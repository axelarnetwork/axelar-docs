# Axelar Executable

## Overview

The Axelar Executable is a component of the [Axelar General Message Passing (GMP)](/dev/general-message-passing/overview/) flow, allowing the execution of custom logic in response to messages from different blockchains. By simply inheriting from the Axelar Executable your contract can process and respond to incoming cross-chain GMP data.

## Integration For GMP Executable 

For a [plain GMP executable](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-tokens-with-messages/) message you can inherit from the [Axelar Executable](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/b5d0b7bdda0437fce983daffb776669437b809d0/contracts/executable/AxelarExecutable.sol) contract.

1. Import **`AxelarExecutable`** from the Axelar GMP SDK to enable cross-chain capabilities.

   ```solidity
   import "@axelar-network/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/contracts/executable/AxelarExecutable.sol";
   ```

1. Inherit Axelar Executable Functions:

   ```solidity
   contract MyContract is AxelarExecutable {}
   ```

1. Implement the `virtual` functions defined in `AxelarExecutable` on your own contracts. The functions you implement on your own contract will be automatically triggered by an Axelar relayer on the destination chain once the multichain transaction arrives on the destination chain

## Integration For GMP With Token Executable

If you are [sending a GMP message with a token](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-tokens-with-messages/)  and need to handle the executable for a token + GMP message then you will need to inherit from the [Axelar Executable With Token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/b5d0b7bdda0437fce983daffb776669437b809d0/contracts/executable/AxelarExecutableWithToken.sol) contract.


1. Import **`AxelarExecutableWithToken`** from the Axelar GMP SDK to enable cross-chain capabilities.

   ```solidity
   import "@axelar-network/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/contracts/executable/AxelarExecutableWithToken.sol";
   ```

1. Inherit Axelar `AxelarExecutableWithToken` Functions:

   ```solidity
   contract MyContract is AxelarExecutableWithToken {}
   ```

1. Implement the `virtual` functions defined in `AxelarExecutableWithToken` on your own contracts. The functions you implement on your own contract will be automatically triggered by an Axelar relayer on the destination chain once the multichain transaction arrives on the destination chain



## Implementation Comparison

Once you have inherited from the respective Executable contract you can now defined the execution function. This varies slightly depending on whether you are using an execution for a plain GMP message or a GMP message with a token.

<tabs>
<tab-item title="execute">
```solidity
/*** For GMP Message ***/
/**
  @param commandId identifier tx that is guaranteed to be unique from the Axelar network
	@param sourceChain The chain where the GMP message is sent from
	@param sourceAddress The address on where the GMP msg is sent from
	@param payload The GMP message being sent
**/
function _execute(bytes32 commandId, string calldata sourceChain, string calldata sourceAddress, bytes calldata payload) internal override {
    // Implement your logic on the destination chain
    string memory myGmpMessage = abi.decode(payload, (string));
}
```
</tab-item>
<tab-item title="executeWithToken">
```solidity
/*** For GMP Message + Token ***/
/**
  @param commandId identifier tx that is guaranteed to be unique from the Axelar network
	@param sourceChain The chain where the GMP message is sent from
	@param sourceAddress The address on where the GMP msg is sent from
	@param payload The GMP message being sent
	@param tokenSymbol The token being sent
	@param amount The amount of the token being sent
**/
function _executeWithToken(bytes32 commandId, string calldata sourceChain, string calldata sourceAddress, bytes calldata payload, string calldata tokenSymbol, uint256 amount) internal override {
	address memory receiver = abi.decode(payload, (address));
	address tokenAddress = gateway.tokenAddresses(tokenSymbol);
	IERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(receiver, amount);
}
```

## Incoming Message Validation

The AxelarExecutable contract allows developers to override the `_execute` and the `_executeWithToken()` function on your own contract. However, the function that is actually triggered by the Axelar relayers are external `execute()` and `executeWithToken()` functions. Since these contracts are external with no relevant modifiers they can in theory be triggered by anyone. This can be a security vulnerability as your own contract’s implementation is dependent on the data being passed into the `execute()` function (which triggers in the internal `_execute()` function you’re overriding).

To solve this problem, AxelarExecutable triggers the Axelar Gateway’s [validateContractCall()](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-solidity/blob/8b0ea6693178457b7c155b1efb3ecba6236857cc/contracts/AxelarGateway.sol#L233) function. This function will validate that the incoming message was approved by the Axelar validators and return true if it was. It will then mark the message as a valid to ensure that it is not called more than once. Only once the message is marked as valid will your `_execute()` function be triggered.

By simply inheriting `AxelarExecutable` and overriding the `_execute()` function defined their you can be confident that the message you’re receiving is an authentic message from the Axelar network.

## Upgradable Contracts

If your contract is upgradeable then you may be unable to inherit from AxelarExecutable as it implements a `constructor` . To get around this issue you can simply call the external `execute()` function (or `executeWithToken()`). By simply making the `execute()` function available the relayer will still trigger this function on your contract and it will run the same way the internal `_execute()` function would if you were overriding from AxelarExecutable. The catch is that the `validateContractCall()` function will not be automatically implemented the way it would be if you were inheriting from AxelarExecutable. To get around this problem simply make sure you implement the `validateContractCall()` functionality yourself in your `execute()` function to ensure the authenticity of the incoming message. Once implemented your `execute()` function should look like this

```solidity

  function execute(
    bytes32 commandId,
    string calldata sourceChain,
    string calldata sourceAddress,
    bytes calldata payload
  ) external {
    bytes32 payloadHash = keccak256(payload);

    if (
      !gateway.validateContractCall(
        commandId,
        sourceChain,
        sourceAddress,
        payloadHash
      )
    ) revert NotApprovedByGateway();

    //The rest of your implementation
 }
```
