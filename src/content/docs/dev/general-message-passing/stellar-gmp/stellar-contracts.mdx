# Stellar Contracts

The core contracts for Axelar's integration with Stellar can be found at the [axelar-cgp-stellar](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-stellar) repository. 

The Rust based GMP contracts can be thought of similarly to their [EVM](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-messages/) counterparts. 

At the core of there are two main contracts involved in sending a GMP message, these are the [Gateway Contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-stellar/tree/main/contracts/axelar-gateway) and the [Gas Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-stellar/tree/main/contracts/axelar-gas-service).

## Stellar Gateway
The Gateway facilitates sending and receiving of cross-chain messages to other chains via the Axelar Network.

For sending a GMP message, the `callContract()` function needs to be triggered.

### CallContract
The `callContract` function triggers your cross-chain message from Stellar to the Axelar Network. When sending a cross-chain message you must specify the destination of your cross-chain message and a given payload.

    
The `callContract` function takes five parameters. 
1. `env`: Standard stellar [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `caller`: The sender of the contract call. 
1. `destination_chain`: Name of the chain the message is being sent to.
1. `destination_address`: Address on the destination chain the message is being sent to.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

```rust
pub fn call_contract(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
){}
```

## Stellar Gas Service
The Gas Service handles cross-chain gas payment when making a GMP request. 

When sending a GMP message before triggering the `call_contract()` function on the Gateway, the `pay_gas()` must be triggered first to pay for the cross-chain transaction.  

### PayGas()
 The `pay_gas()` allows users to pay for the entirety of the cross-chain transaction in a given token. 

 The `pay_gas()` takes seven parameters.
1. `env`: Standard Stellar [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `sender`: The sender of the cross-chain call to the Gateway. 
1. `destination_chain`: Name of the chain the message is being sent to.
1. `destination_address`: Address on the destination chain the message is being sent to.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.
1. `spender`: The `address` spending the funds to cover the transaction.
1. `token`: The token being used for payment
{/* 1. `metadata`: Data sent along with the cross-chain tx <<<<<< CONFIRM */}

Note: The expected [token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-stellar/blob/main/packages/axelar-stellar-std/src/types.rs#L5) is a struct type that requires an `address` and `amount`. 

```rust
fn pay_gas(
    env: Env,
    sender: Address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
    spender: Address,
    token: Token,
    metadata: Bytes,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>;
```

## Stellar Executable
The [Executable](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-stellar/blob/main/contracts/axelar-gateway/src/executable.rs#L9) is a Rust Trait (not an individual contract) that will be used to execute a cross-chain call on a Stellar dapp when Stellar is the receiving chain of a cross-chain message.

### Execute 
The `execute()` function will be triggered by an Axelar relayer when the cross-chain message arrives. Your contract should implement the `execute()` function to handle the incoming cross-chain GMP data.

The `execute()` function takes five parameters.
1. `env`: Standard Stellar [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `source_chain`: The source chain where the gmp message is coming from.
1. `message_id`: Identifier for incoming GMP message.
1. `source_address`: The address on the source chain where the gmp message is coming from.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

```rust
fn execute(
    env: Env,
    source_chain: String,
    message_id: String,
    source_address: String,
    payload: Bytes,
);
```

### Validate & Validate Message
The `validate()` function on the `Executable` will trigger `validate_message()` that is [defined](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-stellar/blob/main/contracts/axelar-gateway/src/contract.rs#L128) on the `Gateway`.

The `validate()` function takes five parameters.
1. `env`: Standard stellar [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `source_chain`: The source chain where the GMP message is coming from.
1. `message_id`: Identifier for incoming GMP message.
1. `source_address`: The address on the source chain where the GMP message is coming from.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

```rust
    fn validate(
        env: Env,
        source_chain: String,
        message_id: String,
        source_address: String,
        payload: Bytes,
    ) {}
```

The `validate()` function will trigger the `validate_message()`, which will confirm that the incoming GMP message is an authenticated message that has been verified by the Amplifier Verifiers. Without ensuring that the message is validated, malicious actors could in theory pass invalid data to be executed by this function, which is why it is critical to ensure that the data being passed in has been marked as approved on the Gateway

```rust
     pub fn validate_message(
        env: Env,
        caller: Address,
        source_chain: String,
        message_id: String,
        source_address: String,
        payload_hash: BytesN<32>,
    ) -> bool {}
```

1. `env`: Standard stellar [env](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/contract-development/environment-concepts) that provides access to the environment the contract is executing within. 
1. `caller`: The intended `destination_address` of the contract call.
1. `source_chain`: The source chain where the GMP message is coming from.
1. `message_id`: Identifier for incoming GMP message.
1. `source_address`: The address on the source chain where the gmp message is coming from.
1. `payload`: A `bytes` representation of the cross-chain message being sent.

Returns a `bool` indicating whether the incoming GMP message is valid or not.
