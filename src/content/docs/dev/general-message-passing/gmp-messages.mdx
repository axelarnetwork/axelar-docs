To call a contract on chain B from chain A, the user needs to call `callContract` on the gateway of chain A, specifying:

- The destination chain, which must be an EVM chain from [Chain names](/dev/reference/mainnet-chain-names).
- The destination contract address, which must inherit from `AxelarExecutable` defined in [AxelarExecutable.sol](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/executable/AxelarExecutable.sol).
- The payload `bytes` to pass to the destination contract.

  **NOTE:** The security of your contracts is limited to the security of the
  chains they integrate with. Since blockchains can have different security
  practices, we recommend doing due diligence on all chains your contract will
  be deployed to.

If you want to try this out directly on the blockchain, you can [use Remix to try out Axelar's GMP](https://remix.ethereum.org/axelarnetwork/axelar-docs/blob/main/public/samples/gmp-senderreceiver.sol).

```solidity
function callContract(
    string memory destinationChain,
    string memory contractAddress,
    bytes memory payload
) external;
```

`AxelarExecutable` has an `execute` function that will be triggered by the Axelar network on the destination chain after the `callContract` function has been executed on the source chain. This will validate the contract call and then invoke _your_ `_execute` method, where you should write any custom logic.

```solidity
function _execute(
    string memory sourceChain,
    string memory sourceAddress,
    bytes calldata payload
) internal virtual {}
```

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">Ensure the payload is encoded `bytes`!</Callout>

The `payload` passed to `callContract` (and ultimately to `_execute` and `_executeWithToken`) has type `bytes`. Use the ABI encoder/decoder convert your data to `bytes`.

Example of payload encoding in JavaScript (using ethers.js):

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// encoding a string
const payload = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  ["string"],
  ["Hello from contract A"],
);
```

Example of payload decoding in Solidity:

```solidity
function _execute(
    string memory sourceChain,
    string memory sourceAddress,
    bytes calldata payload
) internal override {
    // decoding a string
    string memory _message = abi.decode(payload, (string));
}
```
