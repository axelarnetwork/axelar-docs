# General Message Passing (GMP) Sui Example

The following is an end-to-end example of how to use the General Message Passing (GMP) feature in Sui. This example demonstrates how to create a simple cross-chain application that allows users to send messages between Sui and an [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) chain. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/install)
- [Sui Move](https://docs.sui.io/build/move)
- [Sui JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/sui)

## Setup 

This demo will use Sui's Typescript SDK to build and deploy the `move` based on contract. It will use `npm` to install the required dependencies. To begin you can run the following command to spin-up your Sui repository.

```bash
sui move new sui-gmp
```

This will create a new directory called `sui-gmp` with the following structure:

1. `Move.toml`    
1. `sources`      
1. `tests`

You can the run `npm init -y` to add a `package.json` file to the project.

### Move Config

The main configuration for a Sui project is in the `move.toml` file. This file contains the following sections:
- `[package]`: This section contains the package name, version, and authors.
- `[dependencies]`: This section contains the dependencies for the package.
- `[addresses]`: The live addresses of the dependencies for your project.
- `[dev-dependencies]`: The dev-dependencies section allows overriding dependencies for `--test`.
- `[dev-addresses]`: The dev-addresses section allows overwriting named addresses for the `--test`.

For now you can clear the boiler plate config and simply add the following:

```toml
[package]
name = "gmp_example"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

## GMP Package

The GMP Package (akin to a smart contract in the EVM ecosystem) will hold the core logic for the cross-chain application. It will be built using the `move` programming language. You can start it off by creating a new `gmp_example.move` file in the `sources` folder adding the name for the module in the code.

```move
module gmp_example::gmp;
```

Note: The name `gmp_example` must match the name provided in the `move.toml` file that holds the

### `Singleton`

The singleton is a resource type that lives in its own on-chain [object](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/object-model). In the case of this package this object owns the package's [channel](src/content/docs/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-contracts#channel). The `id` of the singleton gives it a unique on-chain object identity.

You can create your package's singleton as follows: 

```rust
public struct Singleton has key {
    id: object::UID,
    channel: Channel,
}
```

Where the `id` is the unique identifier for the on-chain object and the `channel` is imported from the [Gateway dependency](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/tree/main/move/axelar_gateway).

### `Init`

With your singleton now setup, you can create your `initialize` function that will be used to [initialize](https://move-book.com/programmability/module-initializer.html) the GMP package. This function will take a single parameter:

1. `ctx: &mut TxContext`: A mutable reference to [TxContext](https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/tx_context#sui_tx_context_TxContext)

In the `init` function you can then setup a new `object` id, create your unique `channel` and associate the two together via the [transfer::share_object](https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/transfer#sui_transfer_share_object) function to publish a `singleton` resource. 

```rust
fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    // Create a new object id for the singleton
    let singletonId = object::new(ctx);
    // Create a new channel
    let channel = channel::new(ctx);
    // Publish the singleton
    transfer::share_object(Singleton {
        id: singletonId,
        channel,
    });
}
```

### `Send_Message`

With your `channel` now setup for your package you can begin to write the functionality to actually send the cross-chain message. The `send_message()` function will take the following parameters:

1. `singleton: &Singleton`: A reference to the `singleton` resource to identify the `channel`
1. `gateway: &Gateway`: A reference to the [gateway's](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-example/#sui-gateway) published object id that contains key Axelar functionality
1. `gas_service: &mut GasService`: A mutable reference to the [gas service's](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-example/#sui-gas-service) object id 
1. `destination_chain: String`: The name of the destination chain to send the message to
1. `destination_address: String`: The recipient address on the destination chain
1. `payload: vector<u8>`: The payload to send to the destination chain
1. `refund_address: address`: The address to send any surplus gas payment back to
1. `coin: Coin<SUI>`: The gas coin to be spent on message delivery
1. `params: vector<u8>`: For future use, this parameter is currently unused

The function signature can be written out as follows: 

```rust
public fun send_message(
    singleton: &Singleton,
    gateway: &Gateway,
    gas_service: &mut GasService,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: vector<u8>,
    refund_address: address,
    coin: Coin<SUI>,
    params: vector<u8>,
) {}
```

Note: the `gas_service` param is of specified as mutable because you will eventually update the `GasService` resource’s internal state (by consuming the provided coin).

You can now begin to implement the functionality for `send_message()`.

First you can create a new [Message Ticket](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-example/#message-ticket). This can be interacting with the `Gateway's` `prepare_message()` function. 
 
```rust
let message_ticket = gateway::prepare_message(
    &singleton.channel,
    destination_chain,
    destination_address,
    payload,
);
```

The ticket will contain all the relevant parameters needed when triggering a cross-chain message.

Next, you can interact with the `GasService` to pay for the entirety of the cross chain call from the source chain. This can be done by triggering the `pay_gas()` function. The gas payment will be picked up by an Axelar relayer and eventually used to pay for the [execution fee](/dev/gas-service/pay-gas/#execution-fee) on the destination chain. 

```rust
gas_service.pay_gas(
    &message_ticket,
    coin,
    refund_address,
    params,
);
```

Lastly, you can trigger the Gateway's `send_message()` function to trigger the cross-chain message by passing in the `message_ticket` you created earlier. 


```rust
gateway.send_message(message_ticket);
```

The complete `send_message()` function should look like this:

```rust
public fun send_message(
    singleton: &Singleton,
    gateway: &Gateway,
    gas_service: &mut GasService,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: vector<u8>,
    refund_address: address,
    coin: Coin<SUI>,
    params: vector<u8>,
) {
    // Create a new message ticket
    let message_ticket = gateway::prepare_message(
        &singleton.channel,
        destination_chain,
        destination_address,
        payload,
    );

    // Pay for the gas
    gas_service.pay_gas(
        &message_ticket,
        coin,
        refund_address,
        params,
    );

    // Dispatch the cross-chain message
    gateway.send_message(message_ticket);
}
```

### Receive Message

With the package now able to send cross-chain messages, it would be great to also receive messages from other blockchains. This can be done by creating an `execute()` function that will be triggered by our Axelar's relaying infrastructure for any incoming message. The full function signature for the `execute()` function will require two parameters:

1. `call: ApprovedMessage`: The [approved message](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-contracts/#approvedmessage) that was sent from the source chain
1. `singleton: &mut Singleton`: A mutable reference to the `singleton` resource so the package can consume messages from its `channel` 

```rust
public fun execute(
    call: ApprovedMessage, 
    singleton: &mut Singleton
) {}
```

Within the `execute()` function you can then consume the message by triggering the [consume_approved_message()](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-contracts/#consume-approved-message) function that is [defined](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/axelar_gateway/sources/channel.move#L85) in the `Channel` module. Once the message is approved you can `emit` a custom event indicating that the execution has gone through successfully. 

Your complete `execute()` function should look like this:

```rust
public fun execute(
    call: ApprovedMessage, 
    singleton: &mut Singleton
) {
    // Consume the message
    let (_, _, _, payload) = singleton.channel.consume_approved_message(call);

    // Emit Executed event
    event::emit(Executed { data: payload });
}
```

This will lead to an error however as you have not yet defined your event, you can do so up top as follows. Note unlike the `Singleton` struct that had a `key` allowing it to be its own on-chain object, the `Executed` struct has a `copy` + `drop` [abilities](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/enums/move-ability) so the event data can be duplicated into the transaction’s event log and then discarded by off-chain indexers. The event itself simply takes a raw payload of bytes that it will be receiving in the cross-chain call.

```rust
public struct Executed has copy, drop {
    data: vector<u8>,
}
```

With the event now defined up top you should be able to compile the package successfully.

### Register Transaction

Unlike in EVM chains, Sui cross-chain transactions involve an additional step to be able to receive cross-chain messages, beyond just defining the `execute()` function. Packages must be [registered](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-contracts/#relayer-discovery) with the [Relayer Discovery](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/tree/main/move/relayer_discovery). 

You can define a specific function your contract to do just that. The `register_transaction()` function will take the following parameters:

1. `discovery: &mut RelayerDiscovery`: A mutable reference to the `Relayer Discovery` object id. Mutable as the state of the Relayer Discovery will be updated to set the new transaction.
1. `singleton: &Singleton`: A mutable reference to the `singleton` resource.

```rust
public fun register_transaction(
    discovery: &mut RelayerDiscovery, 
    singleton: &Singleton) {
}
```

The first thing you will need to do is create a nested vector for the arguments that will be used by the relayer when calling the `execute()` function.

```rust
let arguments = vector[
    //arg `2` corresponding to ApprovedMessage
    vector[2u8],
    //arg `0` corresponding to an object, which in this case is the singleton 
    concat(vector[0u8], object::id_address(singleton).to_bytes()),
];
```

The `vector[2u8]` corresponds to the `ApprovedMessage` argument that the relayer will need to pass in to the `execute()` function. It is one of [five argument types](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-contracts/relayer-discover/#argument-types) that the relayer will know how to handle. 

Now that the relayer knows to submit the `ApprovedMessage` to the `execute()` function you can also pass the id of the singleton that will consume the message. To pass in the singleton you `concat` the `0x00` argument type, which tells the relayer that it should an expect an object type with object id of the singleton. 

You now have a template for invoking the `gmp::execute()` function.

Next, you will need to create a [transaction](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/relayer_discovery/sources/types/transaction.move) that uses the `arguments` vector you just created. 

The `new_transaction()` function call expects several parameters.

1. `is_final: bool`: For this you simply pass `true` telling the relayer to execute the transaction.
1. `move_calls: vector<MoveCall>`: A vector of [MoveCalls](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/relayer_discovery/sources/types/transaction.move#L44)

```rust
    let transaction = transaction::new_transaction(
        true,
        vector[
            transaction::new_move_call(
                transaction::new_function(
                    address::from_bytes(
                        hex::decode(
                            *ascii::as_bytes(
                                &type_name::get_address(
                                    &type_name::get<Singleton>(),
                                ),
                            ),
                        ),
                    ),
                    ascii::string(b"gmp"),
                    ascii::string(b"execute"),
                ),
                arguments,
                vector[],
            ),
        ],
    );
```

The `is_final` can simply be set to `true`. The `move_calls()` needs to receive the `function`, `arguments`, and `type_arguments` that will be triggered on that package for the object id that is being sent by the relayer. In your case the function is the `execute` function on the `gmp` module. The `arguments` are the `ApprovedMessage` object and the `singleton` you had put together previously, and the `type_arguments` can be left empty for now.


The output of this will be your new `transaction` that you can pass into the Relayer Discover's [register_transaction()](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/relayer_discovery/sources/discovery.move#L93) function along with a reference to your package's `channel` as follows: 

```rust
discovery.register_transaction(&singleton.channel, transaction);
```

Once this is called your package will be registered with the Relayer Discovery so it can begin receiving cross-chain messages.

Lastly you can define your `concat()` helper function to append the arguments used in the `register_transaction()` function.

```rust
fun concat<T: copy>(v1: vector<T>, v2: vector<T>): vector<T> {
    let mut result = v1;
    result.append(v2);
    result
}
```

#### Why is this needed?

In the EVM ecosystem because you inherited from AxelarExecutable, the relayer already knows your contract’s function signature and where to call it. This is because on EVM chains contracts also hold their own storage. On Sui chains package logic is separate from objects that are holding the relevant state. As a result the destination that is sent from the source chain will be the `channel_id` as opposed to the `package_id`. In other words  The package ID just tells you which code to run; the channel ID tells you where to run it and which messages to pull in

## Deploy

At this point your `move` GMP Package is now complete. What remains is to deploy the contract to the Sui testnet and send/receive the cross-chain messages. 

To deploy the contract you can make use of [Sui's Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/sui)

### Setup

To get setup in the root of your project you can run `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file. Next, you can install the following dependencies

- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [mysten/sui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/sui)
- [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander)
- [axelar-cgp-sui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui)

This can be done by running `npm i dotenv @mysten/sui commander @axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui`.

Open a new `scripts` directory and add a `deploy.js`.

You can then begin writing your deploy script by setting up your new command

```js
import { Command } from 'commander';


const program = new Command();
program
  .description('Build and publish a Sui Move package with GMP support')
  .action(async (opts) => {
    try {
      await run(opts);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('❌ Error:', err.message || err);
      process.exit(1);
    }
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

Then define an empty `run()` function up above that will be triggered you when run the script

```js
async function run() {}
```

### Build

You can begin by importing the `execSync` helper up top that will be used to run cli commands from your script.

```js
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
```

Then in the `run()` function you can use `exectSync()` to run the relevant Sui cli command to build the contract.

```js
const buildOutput = execSync(
    `sui move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64`,
    { encoding: 'utf-8' }
);
```

This will return a `buildOutput`, which is the compiled `Move` bytecode serialized as `Base64` strings, packed into a `JSON` object.

You can then obtain the `modules` and `dependencies` from the compiled `buildOutput`.

```js
const { modules, dependencies } = JSON.parse(buildOutput);
```

At this point you should be able to run `node scripts/deploy.js` and build your function. The logs should appears as follows

```bash
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY GasService
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY RelayerDiscovery
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY AxelarGateway
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Utils
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY VersionControl
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING gmp_example
```

### Access Wallet

Before publishing to the blockchain you need to setup your wallet that will send the transaction.

You can create a new `utils/index.js` file where you can define a new function called `getWallet()`

This function will require several imports up top

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/ed25519';
import { SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui/client';
import 'dotenv/config';
```

In the `getWallet()` function will create a new [Ed25519Keypair](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typedoc/classes/_mysten_sui.keypairs_ed25519.Ed25519Keypair.html) and `client` object that can be returned to be used later. The keypair will be created based on your private key that should be saved in your `.env` file.

```js
export function getWallet() {
  const client = new SuiClient({ url: 'https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443' });

  const rawKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
  if (!rawKey) {
    console.error('PRIVATE_KEY not set in your .env');
    process.exit(1);
  }

  const keypair = Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(rawKey);
  return [keypair, client];
}
```

Now back in your main `deploy.js` script in your `run()` function you can call `getWallet()` as follows

```js
  const [keypair, client] = getWallet()
```


### Publish
To publish the package on chain you will need to sign a transaction from your Sui Wallet that deploys the package. 

First import the `Transaction` from the Sui SDK 
```js
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';
```

Then back in your `run()` function you can execute the transaction publishing your package.

```js
//create new tx
const tx = new Transaction();
//publish the package
const [upgradeCap] = tx.publish({ modules, dependencies });
```

The `modules` and `dependencies` being passed are the same ones that were destructured from the build output above.

The `upgradeCap` that is returned is an on-chain resource that the Sui mints for you whenever you publish a package, the address that holds the `cap` is able to upgrade the package at a future point. Further reading on this can be found [here](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/transaction-building/basics#transactions). To ensure you are the one with the ability to upgrade the package that you deploy you can pass the `cap` to your own address. 

This can be done as follows:

```js
//get your sui address
const myAddress = keypair.getPublicKey().toSuiAddress();

//transfer upgrade capability to your address
tx.transferObjects([upgradeCap], myAddress);
```

Now you can go ahead and publish the transaction by calling the `signAndExecuteTransaction()` function from the Sui client. It expects three parameters:

1. `signer`: The signer of the transaction
1. `transaction`: The transaction to be executed
1. `options`: Optional extra configurations to go along with the  transaction

You can make the call as follows:

```js
const response = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
    signer: keypair,
    transaction: tx,
    options: { showObjectChanges: true },
});
console.log('✅ Publish succeeded!');
```

At this point you will have successfully published your package! 

The final thing you will need is to get the `packageId` and the `singletonObjectId` for your package.

At the bottom of your `run()` function you can obtain these two values as follows:

```js
const publishedChange = response.objectChanges.find(c => c.type === 'published');
console.log('📦 Published package ID:', publishedChange?.packageId);


const [gmpSingletonObjectId] = getObjectIdsByObjectTypes(response, [
`${publishedChange.packageId}::gmp::Singleton`,
]);
console.log('🔑 GMP Singleton Object ID:', gmpSingletonObjectId);
```

The `packageId` can be found by going through the `objectChanges` in the `response` for the signed transaction. The `gmpSinlgetonObjectId` however requires a helper function called `getObjectIdsByObjectTypes()`.

This helper function that is yet to be defined will find a specified object in a given transaction and return the object's `objectId`. In your case you need to fine the `objectId` for the `singleton`. The function can be written out as follows:

```js
export const getObjectIdsByObjectTypes = (txn, objectTypes) =>
  objectTypes.map((objectType) => {
    const objectId = txn.objectChanges.find((change) =>
      change.objectType?.includes(objectType)
    )?.objectId;

    if (!objectId) {
      throw new Error(`No object found for type: ${objectType}`);
    }
    return objectId;
})
```


Great! At this point when you run `node scripts/deploy.js` you should see the following logs.

```bash
node scripts/deploy.js

```


## Interact With Contract

The final (and most exciting) thing that needs to be done is to actually interact with the package now that it's live on-chain. In your `scripts` directory, next to your `deploy.js` script you can create a new script called `gmp.js`.

### Setup

This script will also user the `commander` tool to execute

#### Command Setup



Similarly to the `deploy` script, you can begin by setting up a new `Command`. This command however will require significantly more parameters than the deployment did, so as to specify the params for the `send_message()` function in your `move` package.

This will prompt you to pass in 
1. The `destination chain`
1. The `destination address` on the destination chain
1. The `id` of the singleton object (that should be logged in your deployment script)
1. The `fee` you are paying to the [axelar gas service](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-contracts/#sui-gas-service) when sending the cross-chain transaction.
1. The `payload` for the gmp message being sent
1. The `refundAddress` to receive any surplus funds sent to the gas service 
1. The `packageId` of your live package on the Sui blockchain

```js
const program = new Command()
program
  .command('sendCall')
  .description('Send a GMP call')
  .requiredOption('--destChain <chain>', 'Destination chain')
  .requiredOption('--destAddress <addr>', 'Destination address')
  .requiredOption('--singletonId <singleton>', 'Singleton object ID')
  .requiredOption('--fee <amount>', 'Fee in atomic units')
  .requiredOption('--payload <hex>', 'Payload bytes (hex)')
  .requiredOption('--refundAddress <addr>', 'Refund address')
  .requiredOption('--packageId <packageId>', 'Package ID')
  .action(async (opts) => {
    const args = { ...program.opts(), ...opts }
    const [keypair, client] = getWallet()
    try {
      await run(
        keypair,
        client,
        [
          args.destChain,
          args.destAddress,
          args.singletonId,
          args.fee,
          args.payload,
          args.refundAddress,
        ],
        args.packageId
      )
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Error:', error.message);
      process.exit(1);
    }
  })

program.parseAsync(process.argv)
```

In the `action()` for the command you trigger the `getWallet()` and `run()` functions. The `getWallet()` was previously defined in the `utils/index.js` helper file, it can be imported up top.

The `run()` function can be defined up top we will return to this shortly.

```js
async function run(keypair, client, args, packageId) {}
```

### Send Message

In the `run()` function that you just defined you can begin to implement the functionality to interact with your contract.

First, you can destructure the arguments that were passed in the command

```js
  const [
    destinationChain,
    destinationAddress,
    singletonId,
    feeAmount,
    payload,
    refundAddress,
  ] = args
```

Next, you can create a new `Transaction` object, make sure you import the transaction up top, the way you did in the `deployment` script.

```js
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions'

//back in your run() function add
const tx = new Transaction()
```

Now, you can begin to write up the `moveCall()` to trigger the `send_call()` function. The `moveCall()` will take two parameters

1. `target`: Which entry-function in your module of that package should be invoked
1. `arguments`: The arguments to be passed into the function being called.

Before writing the `moveCall()` it is worth to review the relevant params. Recall the `send_call()` function expects the following params

```rust
public fun send_call(
    singleton: &Singleton,
    gateway: &Gateway,
    gas_service: &mut GasService,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: String,
    payload: vector<u8>,
    refund_address: address,
    coin: Coin<SUI>,
    params: vector<u8>,
) {}
```

In our destructured array you hav already obtained most of these including; `singletonId`, `destination_chain`, `destination_address`, `payload`, and the `refund_address`.

What you still need to pass in is the `gateway`, `gas_service`, `coin`, and the `params`.

To obtain the four missing parameters you can add the following. First for the missing object ids of the Axelar Gateway](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-example/#sui-gateway) and [Gas Service](/dev/general-message-passing/sui/gmp-example/#sui-gas-service) (for the purpose of this demo) you can simply hardcode  values of the relevant object ids.

```js
const gasServiceId = '0xac1a4ad12d781c2f31edc2aa398154d53dbda0d50cb39a4319093e3b357bc27d'
const gatewayId = '0x6fc18d39a9d7bf46c438bdb66ac9e90e902abffca15b846b32570538982fb3db'
```

For the `coin` you must generate the appropriate [coin type](https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/coin#sui_coin_Coin) that the package is expecting. This can be done by running the `splitCoins()` function, from the Sui SDK. 

```js
const unitAmount = getUnitAmount(feeAmount)
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [unitAmount])
```

`getUnitAmount()` can be added as a helper function in your `./utils/index.js` file.

```js
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

export function getUnitAmount(amount, decimals = 9) {
  return ethers.utils.parseUnits(amount, decimals).toBigInt();
}
```

Under the hood the `splitCoins()` function is expecting the `tx.gas`, which translates into your wallet's default gas coin and `unitAmount`, whih is the parsed amount of gas you are sending to pay for the call. The `splitCoins()` function will create a new object of exactly the `unitAmount` you passed in. Further reading can be found [here](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/transaction-building/basics)

Lastly to get the `payload` you can first `encode()` the `payload` into a `uint8array` of raw `bytes`. Then you can wrap that raw `bytes` array into Sui’s [BCS](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/bcs) format for a `vector<u8>`

```js
const encodedPayload = new TextEncoder().encode(payload)
const serializedPayload = bcs.vector(bcs.u8()).serialize(encodedPayload)
```

Finally, with all the required data you can pass it into the `moveCall()` function call from your `tx` object as follows:

```js
tx.moveCall({
    target: `${packageId}::gmp::send_call`,
    arguments: [
        tx.object(singletonId),
        tx.object(gatewayId),
        tx.object(gasServiceId),
        tx.pure(bcs.string().serialize(destinationChain).toBytes()),
        tx.pure(bcs.string().serialize(destinationAddress).toBytes()),
        tx.pure(serializedPayload), //
        tx.pure.address(refundAddress),
        coin, //
        tx.pure(
        bcs
            .vector(bcs.u8())
            .serialize(new Uint8Array(arrayify(0x0)))
            .toBytes()
        ),
    ],
})
```

Everything that is passed in here now has been either explicitly defined in the steps before or passed in as an argument when calling the script. The only item that is not is the very last item in the argument that goes into the `params` field in the `send_call()` function. This can simply be an empty `bcs` encoded `0x0` value.

With the `tx` call now constructed you can trigger the `signAndExecuteTransaction()` on the Sui client to broadcast the transaction to the network.

```js
const receipt = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
    signer: keypair,
    transaction: tx,
    options: {
        showEffects: true,
        showObjectChanges: true,
        showEvents: true,
    },
})

console.log('✅ Tx', receipt.digest)
```
