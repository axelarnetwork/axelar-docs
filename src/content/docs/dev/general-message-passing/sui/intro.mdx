# Sui Integration Introduction

import { Callout } from "../../../../../components/callout";

[Sui](https://sui.io/) is a blockchain that has been integrated with the Axelar Network via the [Interchain Amplifier](/dev/amplifier/introduction/). This integration enables cross-chain communication between Sui and other blockchains in the Axelar ecosystem.

## Overview

Sending messages between Sui and other blockchains follows similar patterns as [GMP messages](/dev/general-message-passing/overview/) on other chains, such as EVM chains. The core packages for Axelar's integration with Sui can be found in the [axelar-cgp-sui](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui) repository.

The integration consists of two main components:

1. **[Gateway Package](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/tree/main/move/axelar_gateway)** - Facilitates the sending and receiving of cross-chain messages.
1. **[Gas Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/tree/main/move/gas_service)** - Handles cross-chain gas payment for GMP requests.

## Key Concepts

### Channels

In Sui, there is no ability to check the immediate caller of a message (unlike `msg.sender` in EVM). The `Channel` object serves as an identifier for who is calling and receiving messages in the Sui ecosystem.

### Message Flow

Sending a message from Sui involves these key steps:

1. Prepare the message via the Gateway.
1. Pay gas via the Gas Service.
1. Send the message via the Gateway.

Receiving a message involves:

1. Register your transaction with the [relayer discovery service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/tree/main/move/relayer_discovery).
1. Message approval by Axelar relayers.
1. Message execution on your Sui contract.
