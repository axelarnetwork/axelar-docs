# What is Mobius Development Stack?

With few exceptions, the developer and end user experience in Web3 is broken. A Cambrian explosion of L1s and L2s (and soon to-be L3s) are all competing for attention, developers and capital. A multichain future is inevitable, but a lack of composability across chains has created an environment that has led to liquidity fragmentation, disjointed UX, an over-reliance on centralized bridging, and general confusion in-market around where to build and which infrastructure to use. A preponderance of walled-gardens and single points of failure challenge many of the fundamental principles of the Web3 movement. Despite these issues, growth in the number of blockchains shows no signs of slowing, creating a multi-trillion dollar opportunity for interoperability solutions.

Meanwhile, Web2 giants are increasingly isolated behind their moats â€“ willing to do anything at the behest of governments or advertisers, regardless of negative impacts for their users. The internet itself was built with interoperability protocols, but we have diverged from the internet its early builders envisioned.

To address these problems and accelerate the growth potential of a Web3 alternative, the Axelar community has designed the **Axelar Mobius Development Stack (Axelar MDS)**, the next evolutionary step in blockchain engineering. Axelar MDS is the first-and-only permissionless, trustless and open interoperability platform on the market: a family of open tools and protocols that unlock an entirely new omnichain design space. 

With the Axelar MDS, dApp developers can safely build novel omnichain products that tap into entirely new user networks, compute sources, security models, consensus mechanisms or liquidity pools, all through a single connection.

The main components of Axelar MDS are:

- The Interchain Amplifier - newly launched to mainnet
- Flexible, augmented economic security via EigenLayer and Babylon
- Existing Axelar tools and services augment and extend these capabilities
    - The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM)
    - The Interchain Token Service (ITS)
