# Transfer assets using a deposit address (Deprecated)

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: Transfering assets via `deposit addresses` are deprecated. For gateway tokens it is recommended to use `callContractWithToken()` and for other tokens it is recommended to use the `Interchain Token Service`.
</Callout>

A [deposit address](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/token-transfer-dep-addr/) is a temporary one-time address created and monitored by Axelarâ€™s Relayer Services. Deposit addresses generally function for up to 24 hours.

Use a deposit address if:

- You need functionality not offered by the `sendToken()` method, such as Cosmos-to-X.
- You want to allow token transfers from wallets that do not interact with Axelar, such as when withdrawing funds from a centralized exchange.

To transfer assets using a deposit address, install the AxelarJS SDK and initiate an `AxelarAssetTransfer`.
