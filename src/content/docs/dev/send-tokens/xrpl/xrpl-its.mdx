# XRPL Interchain Token Service

The XRPL Blockchain is unique in comparison to other blockchains integrated with Axelar. Unlike other blockchains, XRPL does not support smart contracts. As such there is no Interchain Token Service contract deployed on the chain the way there is with other EVM and non-EVM blockchain integrations.

## XRPL Gateway

The integration leverages the [XRPL Multisig Signing](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/multi-signing) account type to facilitate token transfers. The [gateway](https://github.com/commonprefix/axelar-amplifier/blob/xrpl/contracts/xrpl-multisig-prover/src/xrpl_multisig.rs) is controlled by the [Axelar Verifier set](https://axelarscan.io/verifiers).  

The testnet address for the XRPL Gateway is: [rNrjh1KGZk2jBR3wPfAQnoidtFFYQKbQn2](https://testnet.xrpl.org/accounts/rNrjh1KGZk2jBR3wPfAQnoidtFFYQKbQn2).

The mainnet address for the XRPL Gateway is: [rfmS3zqrQrka8wVyhXifEeyTwe8AMz2Yhw](https://livenet.xrpl.org/accounts/rfmS3zqrQrka8wVyhXifEeyTwe8AMz2Yhw).

Axelar's integration to XRPL allows for the cross-chain transfer of both the XRPL native token (XRP itself) as well as custom tokens ([IOU](https://learn.xrpl.org/glossary/iou/)).


### Transfer Token

The interchain transfer flow is similar to that of the regular [GMP flow](/dev/general-message-passing/xrpl/xrpl-gmp/). As with the regular GMP flow, users will be sending a [payment transaction](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/payment) to the Gateway account. The main difference is that the `MessageType` being sent to the Gateway is an `interchain_transfer` message type instead of a `call_contract` message.

When transferring a token out of XRPL you will be sending the token from your XRPL account to the Gateway contract. The Gateway will be the custodian of your token on XRPL while it is sent via ITS hub to the destination chain. Sending a token will be similar to sending a regular GMP message in that the information that is sent to the Gateway (and eventually to ITS hub) will need to be specified in the [memo](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/common-fields#memos-field) field of the transaction.

What needs to be specified in the `memo` is the following:

1. `type`: The type of the transaction (which will be `interchain_transfer`)
1. `destination_address`: The address of the destination contract on the destination chain.
1. `destination_chain`: The name of the destination chain.
1. `gas_fee_amount`: The amount to be used to cover the gas costs. The transfer amount transfer amount minus this gas fee amount.
1. `payload`: A message to be sent along with the cross-chain asset transfer. This parameter is only needed if you are sending a gmp message, can be ignored if you are simply sending a token without an executable message.

Each of the previously mentioned fields will be passed into the memo as a `MemoType` as an encoded hex. You can then specify the value for each of these fields in the `MemoData` field, also encoded in hex.   

A full `JSON` example of the entire required XRPL Interchain Transfer fields can be as follows:

```json
{
    TransactionType: "Payment",
    Account: user.address, 
    Amount: "1000000", // (1 xrp)
    // Amount: { // alternatively, an IOU token amount can be used to cover gas fees
    //     currency: "ABC", // IOU's currency code
    //     issuer: "r4DVHyEisbgQRAXCiMtP2xuz5h3dDkwqf1", // IOU issuer's account address
    //     value: "1" // IOU amount to bridge (in this case, 1 ABC.r4DVH), *including* gas fee amount
    // },
    Destination: gateway.address, 
    Memos: [
        {
            Memo: {
                MemoType: "74797065", // hex("msg type")
                MemoData: "696e746572636861696e5f7472616e73666572" // hex("interchain_transfer")
            },
        },
        {
            Memo: {
                MemoType: "64657374696e6174696f6e5f61646472657373", // hex("destination_address")
                MemoData: "30413930633041663142303766364143333466333532303334384462666165373342446133353845" // hex("0A90c0Af1B07f6AC34f3520348Dbfae73BDa358E"), in this case: (0x is omitted)
            },
        },
        {
            Memo: {
                MemoType: "64657374696E6174696F6E5F636861696E", // hex("destination_chain")
                MemoData: "7872706c2d65766d2d6465766e6574", // destination chain, hex encoded - hex("xrpl-evm-devnet"), in this case
            },
        },
        {
            Memo: {
                MemoType: "6761735f6665655f616d6f756e74", // hex("gas_fee_amount")
                MemoData: "30", // amount of tokens to allocate to gas fees
            },
        },
        { // Only include this Memo object when performing a GMP call:
            Memo: {
                MemoType: "7061796c6f6164", // hex("payload")
                // abi-encoded payload/data with which to call the Executable destination contract address:
                MemoData: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e474d5020776f726b7320746f6f3f000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

### Example

A full example can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/blob/main/xrpl/interchain-transfer.js).

The example makes use of the [XRPL Client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xrpl)

The XRPL client simplifies the process of connecting to the XRPL network, building transactions, signing them, and submitting them for processing. Key components of the XRPL client include:

The key function in this example is the `interchainTransfer()` function written out as follows.

```js
async function interchainTransfer(_config, wallet, client, chain, options, args) {
    await client.sendPayment(
        wallet,
        {
            destination: chain.contracts.InterchainTokenService.address,
            amount: parseTokenAmount(args.token, args.amount), // token is either "XRP" or "<currency>.<issuer-address>"
            memos: [
                { memoType: hex('type'), memoData: hex('interchain_transfer') },
                { memoType: hex('destination_address'), memoData: hex(args.destinationAddress.replace('0x', '')) },
                { memoType: hex('destination_chain'), memoData: hex(args.destinationChain) },
                { memoType: hex('gas_fee_amount'), memoData: hex(options.gasFeeAmount) },
                ...(options.payload ? [{ memoType: hex('payload'), memoData: options.payload }] : []),
            ],
        },
        options,
    );
}
```

This function constructs the `memo` that will be used for the transaction, passing in the `type`, `destination_address`, `destination_chain`, and `gas_fee_amount`. The [request](https://js.xrpl.org/classes/Client.html#request) functionality of the XRPL client is then used to submit a [signed](https://js.xrpl.org/classes/Wallet.html#sign) transaction.

To interact with the example run the following command

```bash
node xrpl/interchain-transfer.js -e testnet  -n xrpl XRP 1 xrpl-evm 0x312dba807EAE77f01EF3dd21E885052f8F617c5B --gasFeeAmount 100000
```

This will send an ITS transfer to the `0x312dba807EAE77f01EF3dd21E885052f8F617c5B` address on the `XRPL-EVM` chain.

Once the command is run you should as a [transaction](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/gmp/0x8032a4695f4b663a7699da81760997baabb663dea4afc25b78b3434553fcd09d) on the Axelarscan explorer where you can track the entire cross-chain transaction.

#### Insufficient Gas Error

In the event of an `insufficient gas` error, you can unblock the underfunded transaction by running the [Add Gas](/dev/general-message-passing/xrpl/xrpl-gmp/#add-gas) top up the missing funds.
