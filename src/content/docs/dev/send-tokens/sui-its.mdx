# Sui ITS

Axelar's [Interchain Token Service (ITS)](https://www.axelar.network/its) is live on the Sui blockchain to allow for the integration of tokens on Sui to be sent to/from [other ecosystems](https://axelarscan.io/resources/chains) connected to the Axelar Network.


The official Sui integration can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/tree/main/move/interchain_token_service)

## Overview

Interchain Token Service allow teams to deploy fresh new fungible [Interchain Tokens](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/interchain_token/sources/interchain_token.move) as well as integrate custom tokens that want to go cross-chain. ITS is already live on many different EVM and non-evm chains so you can now send your Sui coins to and from those chains.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The simplest way to use ITS is through Axelar's [ITS
  Portal](https://interchain.axelar.dev/), which also supports Sui! ([Testnet
  portal here](https://testnet.interchain.axelar.dev/))
</Callout>

At the package layer, ITS can be broken down into a number of key modules

1. ITS
1. Coin Management
1. Coin Info
1. Token Id
1. Storage

## ITS

This is the module that anyone would directly interact with. It needs to be able to do the following:

1. Register Coin
1. Deploy Remote Interchain Token
1. Send Interchain Transfer
1. Receive Interchain Transfer

### Register Coin

To integrate a token to ITS the `register_coin()` function must be called. This function takes in the following parameters:

1. `its`: The ITS module that will be updated once the new coin is registered
1. `coin_info`: The [coin info](#coininfo) represents the of the coin
1. `coin_management`: The type of [management](#coinmanagement) the token will have with ITS

```move
public fun register_coin<T>(
    self: &mut ITS,
    coin_info: CoinInfo<T>,
    coin_management: CoinManagement<T>,
): TokenId {
    let value = self.value_mut!(b"register_coin");

    value.register_coin(coin_info, coin_management)
}
```

Once triggered, ITS will generate a unique [token id](#tokenid) from the coin's metadata and management details. Then it will [add](https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/bag#sui_bag_add) the tokenId to the `registered_coins` bag. The full implementation of the `register_coin()` function can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/v1.1.3/move/interchain_token_service/sources/versioned/interchain_token_service_v0.move#L166)

See [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/blob/main/sui/its-example.js#L195) for an example of how to register a new coin.

### Deploy Remote Interchain Token

If you are starting from scratch and want to deploy a fresh new token with cross-chain functionality built into it, you can trigger the `deploy_remote_interchain_token()` function. This function will deploy a new *Interchain Token* on a different blockchain via a cross-chain [GMP call](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/overview/#general-message-passing). 

The function takes three parameters:

1. `its`: The ITS module that will be updated once the new coin is registered
1. `token`: The [token_id](#tokenid) representing the token to be deployed on the destination chain
1. `destination_chain`: The name of the destination chain to deploy the token on

```move
public fun deploy_remote_interchain_token<T>(
    self: &ITS,
    token_id: TokenId,
    destination_chain: String,
): MessageTicket {
    let value = self.value!(b"deploy_remote_interchain_token");

    value.deploy_remote_interchain_token<T>(token_id, destination_chain)
}
```

Since this function is making a cross-chain call, it will return a [MessageTicket](TODO) for the cross-chain transaction. The full implementation of the `deploy_remote_interchain_token()` can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/v1.1.3/move/interchain_token_service/sources/versioned/interchain_token_service_v0.move#L178).

See here for an [example](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/blob/main/sui/its-example.js#L107) of how to run a cross-chain deployment for a new token.

### Send Interchain Transfer

Once your token has been integrated with ITS, you can use the `send_interchain_transfer()` function to actually send it cross-chain to another chain where it has been integrated. Sending an interchain transfer is a two step process. The first step is to prepare the [InterchainTransferTicket](#intercha-intransfer-ticket) via the [prepare_interchain_transfer](#prepare-interchain-transfer) function, then once the ticket is created you can trigger the [send_interchain_transfer](#send-interchain-transfer) function.


#### Prepare Interchain Transfer

This will crete the `InterchainTransferTicket` to be passed in to the `send_interchain_transfer()`

The function takes six parameters:
1. `token_id`: The id of the token being sent
1. `coin`: The actual [coin](https://docs.sui.io/standards/coin) being sent
1. `destination_chain`: The name of the chain the coin is being sent to
1. `destination_address`: The address on the destination chain the coin is being sent to
1. `metadata`: Executable data being sent along with the coin for a contract on the destination chain to handle
1. `source_channel`: The channel where the message is being sent to

```move
public fun prepare_interchain_transfer<T>(
    token_id: TokenId,
    coin: Coin<T>,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: vector<u8>,
    metadata: vector<u8>,
    source_channel: &Channel,
): InterchainTransferTicket<T> {
    interchain_transfer_ticket::new<T>(
        token_id,
        coin.into_balance(),
        source_channel.to_address(),
        destination_chain,
        destination_address,
        metadata,
        VERSION,
    )
}
```

#### Send Interchain Transfer

This will trigger the cross-chain call to actually send the token from the source chain to the destination chain.

The function takes three parameters:
1. `its`: The ITS module that will be updated once the new coin is registered
1. `ticket`: The ticket of
1. `clock`: A [clock](https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/clock) module that provides the time of the transfer

```move
public fun send_interchain_transfer<T>(
    self: &mut ITS,
    ticket: InterchainTransferTicket<T>,
    clock: &Clock,
): MessageTicket {
    let value = self.value_mut!(b"send_interchain_transfer");

    value.send_interchain_transfer<T>(
        ticket,
        VERSION,
        clock,
    )
}
```

See here for an [example](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/blob/main/sui/its-example.js#L65) of how to use the `send_interchain_transfer()` 

The full `send_interchain_transfer()` implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/interchain_token_service/sources/versioned/interchain_token_service_v0.move#L212) 

### Receive Interchain Transfer
#### Receive Interchain Transfer With Data

## Coin Management



## Token Id

A `TokenId` is a unique identifier for an ITS integration. Since ITS is a permisionless service anyone can in theory integrate a deployed token, what differentiates between the potentially many different integrations of a token with ITS is the `tokenId`. 

The module for the Sui token id can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-sui/blob/main/move/interchain_token_service/sources/types/token_id.move). 


## Coin Info

The coin info defines the `CoinInfo` type which stores information about a coin:

The following fields are available for CoinInfo

1. `name`: The name of the coin
1. `symbol`: The symbol of the coin
1. `decimals`: The amount of decimals the coin can hold. 
1. `metadata`: The [metadata](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/coin-metadata) for the coin

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Since coins are `u64` some conversion might need to happen when receiving coins as decimals of 18 are too large for Sui to handle.
</Callout>

```move
public struct CoinInfo<phantom T> has store {
    name: String,
    symbol: ascii::String,
    decimals: u8,
    metadata: Option<CoinMetadata<T>>,
}
```


## Interchain Transfer ticket

The Interchain Transfer Ticket contains a unique type to be sent for each transfer. It contains the following fields:

1. `token_id`: The id of the token being sent cross-chain 
1. `balance`: A wrapped [balance](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/balance) object representing the token amount to be transferred, which is later converted to a numeric amount.
1. `source_address`: The address initiating the transfer
1. `destination_chain`: The name of the blockchain where the token is being sent to
1. `destination_address`: The receive address on the destination chain
1. `metadata`: Additional executable data to be sent with the token
1. `version`: The version of ITS that is being used for this transfer

```move
public struct InterchainTransferTicket<phantom T> {
    token_id: TokenId,
    balance: Balance<T>,
    source_address: address,
    destination_chain: String,
    destination_address: vector<u8>,
    metadata: vector<u8>,
    version: u64,
}
```
