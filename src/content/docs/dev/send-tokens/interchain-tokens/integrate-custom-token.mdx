# Integrate Custom Token

import { Callout } from "/src/components/callout";

Custom tokens are independently deployed tokens, as opposed to those deployed via the [Interchain Token Service (ITS)](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol). These tokens are integrated with ITS across different chains by deploying a Token Manager for each.

Once a custom token has a Token Manager deployed on a given chain, it becomes bridgeable between blockchains that also have a token connected to a Token Manager sharing the same [`interchainTokenId`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L262).

## Install the Axelar ITS Dependency

Install the Axelar [Interchain Token Service (ITS) package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axelar-network/interchain-token-service) using npm or any other node package manager:

```bash
npm i @axelar-network/interchain-token-service
```

## Build and Deploy Your ERC-20 Token on Multiple Chains

Build your ERC-20 token and deploy it on multiple chains. You can use a tool like the [Create3 Deployer](/dev/solidity-utilities/#create3-deployer) to ensure your token has the same address across chains.

Example token contract:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";

contract MyInterchainToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable {
    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC20("My Interchain Token", "ITS")
    {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyMinter {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) public onlyMinter {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
}
```

This token is a simple implementation of an ERC-20 token that includes the critical functions needed to integrate with ITS: the ability to `mint()` and `burn()` tokens. ITS calls these functions when bridging tokens between chains.

Alternatively, you can inherit from the [InterchainTokenStandard](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainTokenStandard.sol#L12) so that your token has cross-chain functionality built in, such as the `interchainTransfer()` function.

## Integrate Custom Token with ITS

After deploying your custom tokens on your preferred chains, the next step is to integrate your token with ITS by following these steps:

1. [Register token metadata with the ITS Contract](#register-token-metadata-with-the-its-contract)
2. [Register custom token with the Interchain Token Factory](#register-custom-token-with-the-interchain-token-factory)
3. [Link custom token with the Interchain Token Factory](#link-custom-token-with-the-interchain-token-factory)
4. [Assign the minter role to your token's Token Manager](#assign-the-minter-role-to-your-tokens-token-manager)

### Register Token Metadata with the ITS Contract

Register your token metadata using the [`registerTokenMetadata`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/94677f1072da127a0ee7ff5ab6784dcfe11789e8/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L274) function on the ITS contract. This function registers metadata for a token on the ITS Hub. This metadata is used for scaling linked tokens.
For example, if you are integrating your custom token on chains A, B, and C, you should register token metadata on each chain separately.

```solidity
function registerTokenMetadata(
    address tokenAddress,  // your token address
    uint256 gasValue       // gas value
) external payable {};
```

This function registers metadata for a token on the [ITS Hub](/dev/amplifier/its-hub/introduction/). This metadata is used for scaling linked tokens.

> **Note:** Token metadata must be registered before [`linkToken`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/94677f1072da127a0ee7ff5ab6784dcfe11789e8/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L329) can be called for the corresponding token. This function links a remote token on `destinationChain` to a local token corresponding to the `tokenId` computed from the provided `salt`.

### Register Custom Token with the Interchain Token Factory

After registering token metadata for each of your custom tokens, call the [`registerCustomToken`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/cc6ef7282e18c6b2842cbf1098b06161e38ea32e/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L298) function on the [Interchain Token Factory](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenFactory.sol).

```solidity
function registerCustomToken(
    bytes32 salt, // your unique salt value
    address tokenAddress, // your custom token address
    TokenManagerType tokenManagerType, // token manager type
    address operator // minter address
) external payable returns (bytes32 tokenId) {};
```

This function registers an existing ERC-20 token (your custom token) under a `tokenId` computed from the provided `salt`. A token metadata registration message will also be sent to the ITS Hub. Then, the token can be linked to remote tokens on different chains by submitting the `linkToken` function from the same `msg.sender` using the same `salt`.

Note: This function is called from the Interchain Token Factory rather than directly from ITS because the Factory provides additional utility functions and standardized `tokenId`  computation logic.
It simplifies the deployment process by managing the salt derivation and tracking of token deployments, making it easier for developers to work with custom tokens while maintaining consistency across chains.


### Link Custom Token with the Interchain Token Factory

To link a custom token, use the [`linkToken`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/94677f1072da127a0ee7ff5ab6784dcfe11789e8/contracts/InterchainTokenFactory.sol#L541) function to link your custom tokens on your respective chains.

```solidity
function linkToken(
    bytes32 salt, // your unique salt value previously used
    string calldata destinationChain, // destination chain
    bytes calldata destinationTokenAddress, // destination custom token address
    TokenManagerType tokenManagerType, // token manager type
    bytes calldata linkParams, // operator address
    uint256 gasValue // gas value
) external payable returns (bytes32 tokenId) {}
```

This function does several important things:

1. It computes a `tokenId` using the same salt you used during token registration
2. Creates a cross-chain message that instructs the destination chain to deploy a Token Manager for your token
3. Establishes the connection between your tokens across chains by associating them with the same `tokenId`
4. Sets up the appropriate Token Manager type that defines how tokens will be bridged (lock/unlock, mint/burn, etc.)

When this function executes, it:

- Takes gas payment for the cross-chain message (this is why it's `payable`)
- Routes the message through the ITS Hub to the destination chain
- Triggers the deployment of a Token Manager on the destination chain that's linked to your token

You can see a real example of this function being used in [this transaction on Axelarscan](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/gmp/0x11c2a212180d7ea2babe7aceb66c32c1e235cc159bceeb4dd6d04411f4a9669f), which demonstrates linking a token between BNB chain and Avalanche.

> **Note:** A local token must be registered first using the `registerCustomToken` function. The entire linking process might take a few minutes to complete as the cross-chain message propagates through the Axelar network.

### Assign the `minter` Role to Your Token's Token Manager

Transfer the minter / burn role to the Token Manager using the [`transferMintership`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v/contracts/utils/Minter.sol#L31) function on your token. To retrieve your token manager address, use the `tokenManagerAddress` function on the ITS contract by specifying your `tokenId`.

```solidity
yourToken.transferMintership(tokenManagerAddress);
```

The [`transferMintership()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/utils/Minter.sol#L31) function transfers the minter role to the Token Manager. This is necessary because when your token is bridged to a destination chain, the `msg.sender` of the `mint()` call will be the Token Manager.

## Send Tokens Using the Interchain Transfer Function

An [Interchain Token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainToken.sol) is an ERC-20 connected to [ITS](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol) upon deployment and comes built in with the `interchainTransfer()` function, which allows users to bridge their token between any blockchain on which it is deployed. Refer to the diagram below to see how the `interchainTransfer()` function works.

Use the [`interchainTransfer`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/94677f1072da127a0ee7ff5ab6784dcfe11789e8/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L559) function to send tokens across chains.

```solidity
function interchainTransfer(
    bytes32 tokenId, // token ID
    string calldata destinationChain, // destination chain name
    bytes calldata destinationAddress, // receiver address on destination chain
    uint256 amount, // amount to transfer
    bytes calldata metadata, // metadata (optional)
    uint256 gasValue // gas value sent for the transfer
) external payable whenNotPaused {};
```

The [`interchainTransfer()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/94677f1072da127a0ee7ff5ab6784dcfe11789e8/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L559) function sends a cross-chain transfer via the Interchain Token Service.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
  **Security Note:** The key used to deploy custom tokens is critical for
  security. If that key is compromised, the token can be compromised across
  multiple chains. - Interchain native tokens can only be deployed to additional
  chains via the same deployer key, so that key must be securely retained. -
  Tokens registered on ITS should be cautious about granting mint/burn
  permissions to other contracts. For example, sharing mint permission with the
  Polygon native bridge is not supported (the Polygon native bridge only looks
  for burns, which ITS usesâ€”potentially allowing duplicate sends).
