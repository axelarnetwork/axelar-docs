# Interchain Tokens and the Interchain Token Service

Web3 has gone cross-chain, with assets bridging between blockchains and
developers deploying applications on multiple chains. However, connecting tokens
that are deployed on multiple chains has always been a cumbersome process.


Interchain Tokens go beyond legacy bridges. The [Interchain Token Service (ITS)](https://axelar.network/interchaintokens) allows ERC-20 tokens to be available on multiple blockchains. It preserves native
token qualities while allowing you to easily manage token features and token supply.
Interchain Tokens run on [open-source code](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/tree/main) via smart contracts on a public blockchain secured by a dynamic validator set.
With ITS, you can have multiple blockchains with canonical versions of your token
that all share a single EVM address.


You can either create new [Interchain Tokens](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainToken.sol#L19) from scratch or update tokens that already exist on a [supported blockchain](/resources/contract-addresses/mainnet/).

### Key ITS Contract addresses

## ITS Overview

 The main functionalities of ITS can be broken down in the diagrams below.
  These are the ability to connect tokens across multiple blockchains and
  transfer connected tokens between multiple blockchains. Note: ITS is designed
  to be a flexible permisionless process, meaning that the way tokens are
  connected between the chains can vary for different usecases (see [token managers](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/token-manager/) for more info).



## Deploy Interchain Token

ITS allows you to deploy [Interchain Tokens](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainToken.sol). An Interchain Token is an ERC20 that is connected to [ITS](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol) upon deployment. It comes built-in with the `interchainTransfer()` function, which allows users to bridge their token between any blockchain to which it is deployed. To deploy this token, you can go through the [Interchain Token Factory](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenFactory.sol) contract. 

When you trigger the `registerCanonicalInterchainToken()` function, that will initiate the process of registering your custom token with a `Lock/Unlock` [token manager](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/token-manager/TokenManager.sol) type to your token's *home chain*. Now that you have registered your token on the home chain, you can call the `deployRemoteCanonicalInterchainToken()`. This will deploy an Interchain Token on a different blockchain that will be connected to your canonical token on the home chain you registered when you called the previous function.

Note: This is just one of many different flows you can choose to follow when interacting with ITS.

## Interchain Transfer

<p>
  Once your token is connected to ITS you can call the <code>interchaintTransfer()</code> function to send a cross chain transaction for your token. If your token inherits
  the [Interchain Token Standard](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainTokenStandard.sol) then you will have this function built into the token. The <code>interchainTransfer()</code> will trigger a flow that will interact with <code>ITS</code> to either lock or
  burn your token on the source chain (depending on the Token Manager type) and then
  mint your token on the destination chain.

  **NOTE:** The security of your token is limited to the security of the chains
  it integrates with. Since blockchains can have different security practices,
  we recommend doing due diligence on all chains your token will be deployed to.
