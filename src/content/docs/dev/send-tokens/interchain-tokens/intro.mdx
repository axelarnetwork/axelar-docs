# Interchain Tokens and the Interchain Token Service

Web3 has gone cross-chain, with assets bridging between blockchains and
developers deploying applications on multiple chains. However, connecting tokens
that are deployed on multiple chains has always been a cumbersome process.

Interchain Tokens go beyond legacy bridges. The [Interchain Token Service (ITS)](https://axelar.network/its) allows ERC-20 tokens to be available on multiple blockchains. It preserves native
token qualities while allowing you to easily manage token features and token supply.
Interchain Tokens run on [open-source code](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/tree/main) via smart contracts on a public blockchain secured by a dynamic validator set.
With ITS, you can have multiple blockchains with canonical versions of your token
that all share a single EVM address.

You can either create new [Interchain Tokens](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainToken.sol#L19) from scratch or update tokens that already exist on a [supported blockchain](/resources/contract-addresses/mainnet/).
