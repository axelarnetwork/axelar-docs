The quickest way to begin exploring and deploying [interchain tokens](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/quick-start/programmatic/#interchain-token) is with Axelar's no code [frontend portal](https://interchain.axelar.dev/). (Click [here](https://testnet.interchain.axelar.dev/) for testnet)

The portal offers two main paths. You can either deploy a fresh new token on multiple chains at once or you can connect a pre-existing token to ITS. Once integrated, you can then deploy additional interchain tokens on other blockchains to be bridgeable with your token that you had previously integrated.

## Deploy New Token

To deploy a new token:

1. Connect your wallet.
1. Select a source network where you have funds available.
1. Click **Deploy a new Interchain Token**.
1. Add your new token’s name, symbol, decimals, and amount to mint. You can also mark the token as mintable, which will allow the token minter to mint new tokens.
1. Select additional chains for your token’s to be available on. You can optionally add the token amount to mint on each selected chain.

If your connected wallet has enough funds, your new token will become available on each chain you selected. It will follow the [Interchain Token Standard](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenStandard.sol), so users can call the [`interchainTransfer()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9223108211b977d9138fdd67d5b4a641fc35c18c/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenService.sol#L210) method on the token itself to transfer between blockchains.

## Connect Existing Token

1. Connect your wallet.
1. Select a source network where you have funds available.
1. Paste in the address of your token that you want to connect to ITS
1. Click the **Register interchain token** button.
1. Select additional chains for your token's to be available on.
1. This will register a [lock/unlock](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/ITokenManagerType.sol#L13) Token Manager for your custom token on the home chain and a [native interchain token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/7df851d8a4ec4df819961d704bf3067ee8d37521/contracts/interfaces/ITokenManagerType.sol#L11) on any of the remote chains you register your token on.
