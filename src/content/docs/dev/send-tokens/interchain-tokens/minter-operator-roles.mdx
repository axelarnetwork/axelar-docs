# Minter and Operator Roles in Interchain Token Service

The [Interchain Token Service (ITS)](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/tree/main) uses two key roles to manage permissions and control: **Minter** and **Operator**. These roles implement access control mechanisms that determine who can perform specific actions on tokens and token managers.

## Minter Role

The Minter role controls who can create (mint) and destroy (burn) tokens. This role is critical for managing the token supply across different chains.

Based on the [`IMinter`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IMinter.sol) interface and the contract implementations, a Minter can:

1. **Mint new tokens**: Create new tokens and assign them to any address.
2. **Burn tokens**: Destroy tokens from circulation.
3. **Transfer mintership**: Transfer the minter role to another address.
4. **Propose mintership change**: Propose a new minter (two-step transfer process).

### Implementation Details

When a new Interchain Token is deployed:

- ITS is initially set as the minter for Native Interchain Tokens
- During token manager deployment, mintership can be transferred to the token manager itself
- In [`TokenHandler.sol`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/TokenHandler.sol), there is an automatic migration mechanism that transfers mintership from ITS to the token manager when needed:

```solidity
function _migrateToken(address tokenManager, address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenManagerType) internal {
    if (tokenManagerType == uint256(TokenManagerType.NATIVE_INTERCHAIN_TOKEN) && IMinter(tokenAddress).isMinter(address(this))) {
        IMinter(tokenAddress).transferMintership(tokenManager);
    }
}
```

### Token Manager Integration

For [`NATIVE_INTERCHAIN_TOKEN`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/4ba40851ee13cf98077e38b49f2c106d09a2f67c/contracts/interfaces/ITokenManagerType.sol#L11) and [`MINT_BURN`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/4ba40851ee13cf98077e38b49f2c106d09a2f67c/contracts/interfaces/ITokenManagerType.sol#L15) token manager types, the minter role allows the token manager to mint tokens upon receiving them from another chain and burn tokens when sending them to another chain.

## Operator Role

The Operator role controls who can manage the token manager's configuration and operations. This role has administrative powers over how tokens are handled during cross-chain transfers.

Based on the [`IOperator`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IOperator.sol) interface and contract implementations, an Operator can:

1. **Set flow limits**: Control the rate at which tokens can flow into or out of a chain.
2. **Approve service**: Grant permission to the ITS to operate on behalf of the token manager.
3. **Transfer operatorship**: Transfer the operator role to another address.
4. **Propose operatorship change**: Propose a new operator (two-step transfer process).

### Implementation Details

ITS operators are set during token manager deployment:

```solidity
// From InterchainTokenFactory.sol

bytes memory linkParams = '';
if (operator != address(0)) {
    linkParams = operator.toBytes();
}
```

The `linkParams` is used to specify the operator address for the token manager.

## Role Transitions and Ownership

Both roles feature a secure two-step transfer process:

1. The current role holder proposes a new address (`proposeOperatorship` or `proposeMintership`).
2. The proposed address must accept the role (`acceptOperatorship` or `acceptMintership`).

This prevents accidental transfers to invalid addresses.

## Practical Applications

### Minter Role Usage

1. **Token Supply Management**: The minter can control the total supply by minting or burning tokens.
2. **Cross-Chain Transfers**: For mint/burn token managers, the minter mints tokens on the destination chain equivalent to what was burned on the source chain.
3. **Token Migration**: The [`migrateInterchainToken`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol) function in ITS shows how mintership is transferred to optimize token operations.

### Operator Role Usage

1. **Flow Control**: Operators can set _flow limits_ for how many tokens can flow in or out of a chain in a given period.
2. **Security Governance**: Operators can implement security measures to protect against attacks.
3. **Service Authorization**: Operators can authorize ITS to interact with token managers.

## Role Interaction in ITS

- The ITS contract initially holds the minter role for native interchain tokens.
- The token manager typically becomes the minter to handle cross-chain transfers.
- Custom operators can be specified for token managers.
- When deploying tokens, the factory allows specifying both minter and operator roles:

```solidity
// From InterchainTokenFactory.sol

token.transferMintership(minter);
tokenManager.removeFlowLimiter(address(this));
tokenManager.addFlowLimiter(minter);
tokenManager.transferOperatorship(minter);
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Separation**: Minter and Operator roles can be held by different entities for better security.
2. **Flow Limits**: Operators can set flow limits to prevent large-scale attacks.
3. **Careful Role Transfer**: The two-step transfer process mitigates the risk of losing control.

The Minter and Operator roles form the foundation of ITS's permission system. Developers can build secure and efficient cross-chain token solutions by understanding how these roles function and interact.
