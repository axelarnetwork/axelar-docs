# Minter and Operator Roles in Interchain Token Service

The [Interchain Token Service (ITS)](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/tree/main) uses two key roles to manage permissions and control: **Minter** and **Operator**. These roles implement access control mechanisms that determine who can perform specific actions on tokens and token managers.

## Minter Role

The Minter role controls who can create (mint) and destroy (burn) tokens. This role is critical for managing the token supply across different chains.

Based on the [`IMinter`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IMinter.sol) interface and the contract implementations, a Minter can:

1. **Mint new tokens**: Create new tokens and assign them to any address.
2. **Burn tokens**: Destroy tokens from circulation.
3. **Transfer mintership**: Transfer the minter role to another address.
4. **Propose mintership change**: Propose a new minter (two-step transfer process).

### Implementation Details

When a new Interchain Token is deployed:

- ITS is initially set as the minter for Native Interchain Tokens.
- The token manager needs to have the minter role in order to mint tokens when receiving them from another chain and burn tokens when sending them to another chain.

There are two primary ways mintership is transferred to the token manager:

1. Automatic Migration: The [`TokenHandler.sol`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/TokenHandler.sol) contract contains an automatic migration mechanism that transfers mintership from ITS to the token manager when tokens are processed:

```solidity
function _migrateToken(address tokenManager, address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenManagerType) internal {
    if (tokenManagerType == uint256(TokenManagerType.NATIVE_INTERCHAIN_TOKEN) && IMinter(tokenAddress).isMinter(address(this))) {
        IMinter(tokenAddress).transferMintership(tokenManager);
    }
}
```

2. Manual Migration: Developers can also explicitly migrate mintership by calling the migrateInterchainToken function on the InterchainTokenService contract:

```solidityC
function migrateInterchainToken(bytes32 tokenId) external onlyOwner {
    ITokenManager tokenManager_ = deployedTokenManager(tokenId);
    address tokenAddress = tokenManager_.tokenAddress();
    IMinter(tokenAddress).transferMintership(address(tokenManager_));
}
```

#### Why Token Managers Need Minter Rights:

For the interchain token system to work properly, token managers need minting and burning capabilities because:

- When tokens are sent from Chain A to Chain B, tokens are burned (or locked) on Chain A and must be minted on Chain B.
- Without minter rights, the token manager cannot mint the corresponding tokens on the destination chain.
- Having the token manager as the minter creates a trustless system where ITS doesn't need to maintain privileged access to tokens.
- It allows the token manager to directly control token supply according to cross-chain message validation.

### Token Manager Integration

For [`NATIVE_INTERCHAIN_TOKEN`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/4ba40851ee13cf98077e38b49f2c106d09a2f67c/contracts/interfaces/ITokenManagerType.sol#L11) and [`MINT_BURN`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/4ba40851ee13cf98077e38b49f2c106d09a2f67c/contracts/interfaces/ITokenManagerType.sol#L15) token manager types, the minter role allows the token manager to mint tokens upon receiving them from another chain and burn tokens when sending them to another chain.
Its important to note that token manager is required to be whitelisted for these manager types to be used otherwise the manager will not be able to mint/burn.

## Operator Role

The Operator role controls who can manage the token manager's configuration and operations. This role has administrative powers over how tokens are handled during cross-chain transfers.

Based on the [`IOperator`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IOperator.sol) interface and contract implementations, an Operator can:

1. **Set flow limits**: Control the rate at which tokens can flow into or out of a chain.
2. **Approve service**: Grant permission to the ITS to operate on behalf of the token manager.
3. **Transfer operatorship**: Transfer the operator role to another address.
4. **Propose operatorship change**: Propose a new operator (two-step transfer process).

### Implementation Details

ITS operators are set during token manager deployment:

```solidity
// From InterchainTokenFactory.sol

bytes memory linkParams = '';
if (operator != address(0)) {
    linkParams = operator.toBytes();
}
```

The `linkParams` is used to specify the operator address for the token manager.

## Role Transitions and Ownership

Both roles feature a secure two-step transfer process:

1. The current role holder (operator or minter) proposes a new address (`proposeOperatorship` or `proposeMintership`).
2. The proposed address must accept the role (`acceptOperatorship` or `acceptMintership`).

This prevents accidental transfers to invalid addresses.

## Practical Applications

### Minter Role Usage

1. **Token Supply Management**: The minter can control the total supply by minting or burning tokens.
2. **Cross-Chain Transfers**: For mint/burn token managers, the minter mints tokens on the destination chain equivalent to what was burned on the source chain.
3. **Token Migration**: The [`migrateInterchainToken`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol) function in ITS shows how mintership is transferred to optimize token operations.

### Operator Role Usage

1. **Flow Control**: Operators can set _flow limits_ for how many tokens can flow in or out of a chain in a given period.
3. **Service Authorization**: Operators can authorize ITS to interact with token managers.

## Role Interaction in ITS

- The ITS contract initially holds the minter role for native interchain tokens.
- The token manager typically becomes the minter to handle cross-chain transfers.
- Custom operators can be specified for token managers.
- When deploying tokens, the factory allows specifying both minter and operator roles:

```solidity
// From InterchainTokenFactory.sol

token.transferMintership(minter);
tokenManager.removeFlowLimiter(address(this));
tokenManager.addFlowLimiter(minter);
tokenManager.transferOperatorship(minter);
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Separation**: Minter and Operator roles can be held by different entities for better security.
2. **Flow Limits**: Operators can set flow limits to prevent large-scale attacks.
3. **Careful Role Transfer**: The two-step transfer process mitigates the risk of losing control.

The Minter and Operator roles form the foundation of ITS's permission system. Developers can build secure and efficient cross-chain token solutions by understanding how these roles function and interact.
