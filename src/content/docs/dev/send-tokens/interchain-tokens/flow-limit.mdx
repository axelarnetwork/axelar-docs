# Flow Limit in Interchain Token Service

## Overview

A `FlowLimit` ensures the stability and security of interchain operations by setting constraints on the volume of tokens that can be transferred within a specified time frame. This prevents system abuse and overload, which is crucial in Interchain transfers, and can be used to prevent transfers of a token on a chain that is undergoing an emergency situation. Flow limits are managed by the [`FlowLimit` contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v1.0.0/contracts/utils/FlowLimit.sol).

The `FlowLimit` contract is [used by](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v1.0.0/contracts/token-manager/TokenManager.sol#L15) the [token manager contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v1.0.0/contracts/token-manager/TokenManager.sol#L21). These token managers, use the `FlowLimit` functionalities to set cross-chain transfer volume going in and out of a given blockchain.

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of how the `FlowLimit` contract operates within the context of [Interchain token transfers](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v1.0.0/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L455).

## Core Aspects

The following are core aspects of the `FlowLimit` contract.

### Flow Limit Management

- Uses a **flow limit**, or a ceiling on the net token flow (difference between flow in and out) within a defined `EPOCH_TIME` (currently set to [6 hours](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/0a00533f19197a285d6bddc8ec0c2e908094ebfe/contracts/utils/FlowLimit.sol#L18)) to manage the number of tokens entering and leaving a blockchain
- Ensures that the amount of tokens transferred in or out does not exceed the predefined limits within each epoch
- Role-based functions in the contract, such as `setFlowLimit`, allow authorized users to manage and adjust the flow limits, adapting to varying network conditions and requirements
- Uses [custom errors](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/0a00533f19197a285d6bddc8ec0c2e908094ebfe/contracts/utils/FlowLimit.sol#L104C20-L104C37) such as `FlowLimitExceeded` to handle cases where a transfer exceeds the permitted flow limit

### Dynamic Slot Allocation

- Uses efficient low-level assembly for peak performance
- Dynamically calculates storage slots for flow amounts based on the current epoch, optimizing storage use

## Public View Functions

The `FlowLimit` contract contains the following public functions.

### `flowLimit()`

Returns the current flow limit value.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Returns the current flow limit.
 * @return flowLimit_ The current flow limit value.
 */
function flowLimit() public view returns (uint256 flowLimit_) {
    assembly {
        flowLimit_ := sload(FLOW_LIMIT_SLOT)
    }
}
```

### `flowOutAmount()`

Returns the current total amount of tokens that have flowed out in the current epoch.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Returns the current flow out amount.
 * @return flowOutAmount_ The current flow out amount.
 */
function flowOutAmount() external view returns (uint256 flowOutAmount_) {
    uint256 epoch = block.timestamp / EPOCH_TIME;
    uint256 slot = _getFlowOutSlot(epoch);

    assembly {
        flowOutAmount_ := sload(slot)
    }
}
```

### `flowInAmount()`

Returns the current total amount of tokens that have flowed in the current epoch.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Returns the current flow in amount.
 * @return flowInAmount_ The current flow in amount.
 */
function flowInAmount() external view returns (uint256 flowInAmount_) {
    uint256 epoch = block.timestamp / EPOCH_TIME;
    uint256 slot = _getFlowInSlot(epoch);

    assembly {
        flowInAmount_ := sload(slot)
    }
}
```

## Internal Management Functions

The `FlowLimit` contract contains the following internal functions.

### `_setFlowLimit(uint256, bytes32)`

Sets the flow limit for a specific token.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Internal function to set the flow limit.
 * @param flowLimit_ The value to set the flow limit to.
 * @param tokenId The id of the token to set the flow limit for.
 */
function _setFlowLimit(uint256 flowLimit_, bytes32 tokenId) internal {
    assembly {
        sstore(FLOW_LIMIT_SLOT, flowLimit_)
    }

    emit FlowLimitSet(tokenId, msg.sender, flowLimit_);
}
```

### `_addFlowOut(uint256)`

Adds to the flow out amount, ensuring it does not exceed the flow limit.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Adds a flow out amount.
 * @param flowOutAmount_ The flow out amount to add.
 */
function _addFlowOut(uint256 flowOutAmount_) internal {
    uint256 flowLimit_ = flowLimit();
    if (flowLimit_ == 0) return;

    uint256 epoch = block.timestamp / EPOCH_TIME;
    uint256 slotToAdd = _getFlowOutSlot(epoch);
    uint256 slotToCompare = _getFlowInSlot(epoch);

    _addFlow(flowLimit_, slotToAdd, slotToCompare, flowOutAmount_);
}
```

### `_addFlowIn(uint256)`

Adds to the flow in amount, also ensuring adherence to the flow limit.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Adds a flow in amount.
 * @param flowInAmount_ The flow in amount to add.
 */
function _addFlowIn(uint256 flowInAmount_) internal {
    uint256 flowLimit_ = flowLimit();
    if (flowLimit_ == 0) return;

    uint256 epoch = block.timestamp / EPOCH_TIME;
    uint256 slotToAdd = _getFlowInSlot(epoch);
    uint256 slotToCompare = _getFlowOutSlot(epoch);

    _addFlow(flowLimit_, slotToAdd, slotToCompare, flowInAmount_);
}
```

## Setting and Overriding Flow Limits in ITS

There are several options for setting and overriding flow limits in the Interchain Token Service.

### Fully managed flow limits

If you want Axelar to manage the flow limits for the token and not deal with it yourself:

- Deploy the token with the `minter` address set to `address(0)`

### Partially managed flow limits

If you want to manage the flow limits together with Axelar:

- Deploy the token with the `minter` address set to your Deployer account or a multi-sig wallet
  If you want to manage the flow limits alone:
- Deploy the token with the `minter` address set to your Deployer account
- Call `tokenManager.removeFlowLimiter(itsAddress)` to remove flow limit management by Axelar

### Unmanaged flow limits

If you don't want anyone to manage flow limits:

- Deploy the token with the `minter` address set to your Deployer account
- Call `tokenManager.removeFlowLimiter(itsAddress)` to remove flow limit management by Axelar
- Call `tokenManager.removeFlowLimiter(minter)` to remove flow limit management by the minter
- Call `tokenManager.transferOperatorship(address(0))` to remove operatorship

The following is an example of how to set a flow limit using the `setFlowLimits` method. You might want to increase the limit to the max before removing access granted to yourself.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Used to set a flow limit for a token manager that has the service as its operator.
 * @param tokenIds An array of the tokenIds of the tokenManagers to set the flow limits of.
 * @param flowLimits The flowLimits to set.
 */
function setFlowLimits(bytes32[] calldata tokenIds, uint256[] calldata flowLimits) external onlyRole(uint8(Roles.OPERATOR)) {
    uint256 length = tokenIds.length;
    if (length != flowLimits.length) revert LengthMismatch();

    for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
        ITokenManager tokenManager = ITokenManager(validTokenManagerAddress(tokenIds[i]));
        // slither-disable-next-line calls-loop
        tokenManager.setFlowLimit(flowLimits[i]);
    }
}
```
