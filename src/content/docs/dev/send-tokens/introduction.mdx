# Overview
Axelar offers cross-chain ERC20 token transfer in two main forms. Gateway tokens and Interchain Token Service based tokens. For general users looking to integrate their own tokens it is recommmended to use ITS. For Dapps looking to make use of more widely recognized assets such as `axlUSDC` or `axlETH`, Gateway tokens serve as a simple solution.

## Gateway Tokens
Gateway tokens are a collection of well known ERC20 tokens that have been wrapped by the Interop Labs team to provide easy cross-chain liquidity between blockchains. The full list of available Gateway tokens can be found [here](/resources/contract-addresses/mainnet/#assets).
More on how to use/send Gateway tokens can be found [here](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-tokens-with-messages/)

## Interchain Token Service Tokens (ITS)
Axelar also offers the ability to make use of ITS. This is a permisionless service where any user (both technical and non technical!) can integrate existing tokens to provide cross-chain functionality for those tokens. Users can also create fresh new ERC20s with cross-chain functionality out of the box.
More details on ITS can be found [here](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/intro/)
