# Manual Relaying Cosmos 2-way Calls

## Overview

Axelar’s off-chain relayer service currently does not support the automatic processing of two-way calls through Cosmos chains. This limitation can affect to halt at the confirmation step. This guide covers how to manually process these transactions to ensure successful completion.

## Manual Relay Process

To manually process a two-way transaction to Cosmos through the Axelar network, perform the following steps:

1. Confirm the gateway transaction on Axelar after the source chain transaction reaches finality.
2. Monitor the Axelar network for the `MessageReceived` event.
3. Manually route the message using the `RouteMessage` transaction on Axelar.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Confirm the Gateway Transaction

After your transaction on the source chain has reached finality, manually confirm it on the Axelar network using the `ConfirmGatewayTx` command.

### Command Usage

```bash
axelard tx evm confirm-gateway-tx \\
<source_chain_name> \\
<source_chain_name_tx_hash> \\
  --from <your_axelar_account> \\
  --gas auto \\
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \\
  -y
```

- `<source_chain_name>`: The source chain name
- `<source_chain_name_tx_hash>`: The hash of your source chain transaction
- `<your_axelar_account>`: Your Axelar account name or key

### Example

```bash
axelard tx evm confirm-gateway-tx \\
ethereum \\
0x0eb22acad0b37b2ebfca573944ccd41078ab61a057be8237c62818c0928618b1 \\
  --from my_axelar_key \\
  --gas auto \\
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \\
  -y
```

### Notes

- Ensure the source chain transaction is fully confirmed before executing this command
- The `y` flag confirms the transaction without prompting

### 2. Monitor for the `MessageReceived` Event

After confirming the gateway transaction, wait for the `MessageReceived` event on the Axelar network. This event indicates that the message from the source chain has been received and is ready to be routed.

### How to Monitor

- AxelarScan Explorer: Visit [AxelarScan Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/) and search for your transactions or events related to your account.
- RPC/WebSocket: Use Axelar's RPC endpoints to programmatically listen for events by polling every block height, as indicated [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/blob/2a8810a295bfa8c5831ef8e2dcbfb0fe16d6be4d/vald/start.go#L231).

### Event Details

The `MessageReceived` event provides the following information:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the message, e.g., `0x07ff5d7fa8f782f1...-6`.
- **payload_hash**: The hash of the message payload.
- **recipient**: JSON object containing the recipient's chain information and address.
- **sender**: JSON object containing the sender's chain information and address.

**Example Event Data**:

```json
{
  "id": "0x07ff5d7fa8f782f149a54a2d7f3fa5508777bfee11024b91a5e44e7423101ce7-6",
  "payload_hash": "Oed6eTDbnou/OWAs5qipbsClgpgMeaCrWNxH1OSWxnY=",
  "recipient": {
    "chain": {
      "name": "warden",
      "supports_foreign_assets": true,
      "key_type": "KEY_TYPE_NONE",
      "module": "axelarnet"
    },
    "address": "warden1yatzc54ln59caxxnj53rff2s359pezx3hqxpzu2tkyl2f9ud9yvsnvmcme"
  },
  "sender": {
    "chain": {
      "name": "ethereum-sepolia",
      "supports_foreign_assets": true,
      "key_type": "KEY_TYPE_MULTISIG",
      "module": "evm"
    },
    "address": "0xc13328bA9657C94aFfbf4f7d257d61e48199802A"
  }
}
```

### 3. Route the Message Manually

Once the `MessageReceived` event is confirmed, manually route the message by executing `RouteMessageRequest` using [this RPC message](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/blob/29bb3e905af28ccf10cc1f61d50afa4b9a38038e/proto/axelar/axelarnet/v1beta1/tx.proto#L163).

### Command Definition

```bash
axelard tx axelarnet route-message \
  "<message_id>" \
  "<payload>" \
  --from "<your_axelar_account>" \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  -y
```

- `<message_id>`: The `id` from the `MessageReceived` event.
- `<payload>`: The payload data you want to route.
- `<your_axelar_account>`: Your Axelar account name or key.

### Example

```bash
axelard tx axelarnet route-message \
  "0x0eb22acad0b37b2ebfca573944ccd41078ab61a057be8237c62818c0928618b1-6" \
  "<payload>" \
  --from "my_axelar_key" \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  -y
```

### Notes

- Replace the placeholder values with actual data from the `MessageReceived` event.
- Ensure that the payload is correctly formatted and encoded if necessary.

## Additional Information

- **Error Handling**: If any step fails, verify the correctness of all provided parameters and ensure network connectivity.
- **Automation**: While this process is manual due to current limitations, you can script these commands to streamline the workflow.
