# Static configs

## Introduction

All of the static constants that are relevant for the chain have been aggregated into a single file.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Chain info and its relevant configs
- All supported assets on each chain

The configuration documents are versioned so you will know if the object changes.

You can access the configs in one of two ways:

## Point the json files directly

- Testnet: https://axelar-testnet.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/configs/testnet-config-1.x.json
- Mainnet: https://axelar-mainnet.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/configs/mainnet-config-1.x.json

## Typescript API

Alternatively, you can use the hooks, i.e.

The package can be installed into your dApp as a project dependency with:

```bash
npm i @axelarjs/api
```

Then run

```typescript
import { createAxelarConfigClient } from "@axelarjs/api";
import { ENVIRONMENTS } from "@axelarjs/core";

const test = async () => {
  const api = createAxelarConfigClient(ENVIRONMENTS.testnet);
  const configs = await api.getAxelarConfigs(ENVIRONMENTS.testnet);
  Object.entries(configs.chains).forEach((v) =>
    console.log(`config for chain ${v[0]}: ${v[1]}`),
  );
};
test();
```

Each of the relevant properties in the schema are typed out in the following Typescript interfaces: https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarjs/blob/main/packages/api/src/axelar-config/types.ts
