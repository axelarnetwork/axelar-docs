Upgrade height `16837700` [countdown](https://www.mintscan.io/axelar/block/16837700)

## About the v1.2 upgrade
The `v1.2` upgrade is a consensus breaking release for Axelar mainnet.

1. If you're a validator or have delegated to one, please vote for the upgrade proposal via

```bash
axelard tx gov vote 284 yes --from validator
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  `axelard` must be built with `go-1.23` for this release.

  Node operators using binaries need to update `wasmvm` from `v1.3.1` to `v1.5.8` [libwasmvm.x86_64.so](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/releases/tag/v1.5.8), and add the folder containing the library to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
  
  If using the community node setup scripts, please update to the latest commit on `main` first.
  `wasmvm` lib will be auto-downloaded to `$AXELARD_HOME/lib` but you'll need to add it to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before running the script.
</Callout>


2. Wait for the proposed upgrade block, `16837700`. Your node will panic at that block height with a log: `{"level":"error","module":"consensus","err":"UPGRADE \"v1.2\" NEEDED at height: 16837700",`. Stop your node after chain halt.

```bash
pkill -f 'axelard start'
# Validators need to also stop vald/tofnd
pkill -f 'vald-start'
pkill -f tofnd
```

3. Backup the state:

```bash
cp -r ~/.axelar/.core/data ~/.axelar-dojo-1-upgrade-1.2.1/.core/data
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Caution: If you backup the entire folder, `~/.axelar/.core`, that'll
  also include your private keys (inside `config` and `keyring-file`
  subfolders). That can be dangerous if anyone gets access to your backups. We
  recommend backing up keys separately when you first create your node, and then
  excluding them from any data backups.
</Callout>

4. Restart your `axelard` node with the new `v1.2.1` build.
5. If you're a validator also restart `vald` with `v1.2.1` and `tofnd` with `v1.0.1`.

Example using join scripts in [axelarate-community git repo](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community):

```bash
# in axelarate-community repo
git checkout main
git pull
KEYRING_PASSWORD="pw-1" ./scripts/node.sh -n mainnet -a v1.2.1
# For validators, restart vald/tofnd
KEYRING_PASSWORD="pw-1" TOFND_PASSWORD="pw-2" ./scripts/validator-tools-host.sh -n mainnet -a v1.2.1 -q v1.0.1
```
