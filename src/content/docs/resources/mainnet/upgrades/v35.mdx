## About the v0.35 upgrade

This release adds the Axelar Virtual Machine to the network and adds support for CosmWasm contract creation.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This release enables CosmWasm. Contracts created with CosmWasm will require
  [governance proposals](/dev/amplifier/chain-integration/governance-proposals/)
  to be deployed for the indefinite future.
</Callout>

Instructions for `2024-March-14` mainnet upgrade to axelar-core `v0.35.5`, vald `v0.35.5`, and tofnd `v0.10.1`.
Release can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/releases/tag/v0.35.5).

Upgrade height `11795700` [countdown](https://www.mintscan.io/axelar/block/11795700)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  [Go v1.21](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.21) will be needed to build `axelard`.

Node operators using binaries need to download `wasmvm v1.3.1` [libwasmvm.x86_64.so](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/releases/tag/v1.3.1) and add the parent folder to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Node operators will need to use the updated [`cosmsprund`](https://github.com/binaryholdings/cosmprund/pull/26) to prune their nodes.

If using the community node setup scripts, please update to the latest commit on `main` first.
`wasmvm` lib will be auto-downloaded to `$AXELARD_HOME/lib` but you'll need to add it to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before running the script.

1. If you're a validator or have delegated to one, please vote for the upgrade proposal via

```bash
axelard tx gov vote 195 [yes|no] --from validator
```

2. Wait for the proposed upgrade block, `11795700`. Your node will panic at that block height with a log: `{"level":"error","module":"consensus","err":"UPGRADE \"v0.35\" NEEDED at height: 11795700", ...}`. Stop your node after chain halt.

```bash
pkill -f 'axelard start'
# Validators need to also stop vald/tofnd
pkill -f 'vald-start'
pkill -f tofnd
```

3. Backup the state:

```bash
cp -r ~/.axelar/.core/data ~/.axelar-dojo-1-upgrade-0.34/.core/data
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Caution: If you backup the entire folder, `~/.axelar/.core`, that'll also
  include your private keys (inside `config` and `keyring-file` subfolders).
  That can be dangerous if anyone gets access to your backups. We recommend
  backing up keys separately when you first create your node, and then excluding
  them from any data backups.
</Callout>

4. Restart your `axelard` node with the new `v0.35.5` build.
5. If you're a validator also restart `vald` with `v0.35.5` and `tofnd` with `v0.10.1`.

Example using join scripts in [axelarate-community git repo](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community):

```bash
# in axelarate-community repo
git checkout main
git pull
KEYRING_PASSWORD="pw-1" ./scripts/node.sh -n mainnet -a v0.35.5
# For validators, restart vald/tofnd
KEYRING_PASSWORD="pw-1" TOFND_PASSWORD="pw-2" ./scripts/validator-tools-host.sh -n mainnet -a v0.35.5 -q v0.10.1
```
