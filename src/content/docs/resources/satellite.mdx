## What is Satellite?

Satellite is a web application built on top of the Axelar Network. It provides an easy to use interface which enables users to transfer their crypto assets from one chain to another.

## Getting Started

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Caution: Satellite is used to transfer real assets across main networks. When
  using it for the first time, try transferring small amounts initially. If you
  need assistance, use the `FAQ` and `Support` buttons in Satellite for help.
