# Add Account to Axelarscan

## Overview

The ability to add metadata about important on-chain addresses allows users to have a simpler experience seeing on-chain activity for these addresses.

Rather than seeing a raw address on Axelarscan, users will be able to see a customized photo and name for a given address:

## How to Add

To add a new address to the list of tracked addresses in the [accounts directory](https://github.com/CoinHippo-Labs/axelarscan-ui/blob/main/data/accounts/index.js), send a [pull request](https://github.com/CoinHippo-Labs/axelarscan-ui/pulls) to the [Axelarscan-UI repository](https://github.com/CoinHippo-Labs/axelarscan-ui/tree/main).

Include the following parameters:

* Address: The address you are looking to add.
* Name: The name you want to be displayed for your address.
* Image: The image you want to appear alongisde the name.
* Environment: Whether this address is for mainnet or testnet transactions.

## Example

The following example adds the Axelar Governance Address referenced in the image above to the accounts directory.

```javascript
export default [
  {
    address: 'axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj',
    name: 'Axelar Governance',
    image: '/logos/accounts/axelarnet.svg',
  }
]
```

No `environnment` was set, so this address will appear on both [mainnet](https://axelarscan.io/account/axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj) and [testnet](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/account/axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj).

Add the following to include the address on mainnet only:

```javascript
export default [
  {
    address: 'axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj',
    name: 'Axelar Governance',
    image: '/logos/accounts/axelarnet.svg',
    environnment: 'mainnet'
  }
]
```
