# Add Account to Axelarscan

## Overview

The ability to add metadata about important on-chain addresses allows users to have a simpler experience seeing on-chain activity for these addresses.

Rather than seeing a raw address on Axelarscan users will be able to see a customized photo and name for a given address.

The difference between an address with and without metadata can be seen here.

## How to Add

Adding your address is as simple as sending a pull request to the [Axelarscan-UI repository](https://github.com/CoinHippo-Labs/axelarscan-ui/tree/main). 

In this repo, you must add the new address to the list of tracked addresses in the [accounts directory](https://github.com/CoinHippo-Labs/axelarscan-ui/blob/main/data/accounts/index.js)

When adding the new address, the following parameters will need to be included:

1. Address: The address you are looking to add.
2. Name: The name you want to be displayed for your address.
3. Image: The image you want to appear alongisde the name.
4. Environment: If this address is for mainnet or testnet transactions.
Once you have added the parameters for your contract you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/CoinHippo-Labs/axelarscan-ui/pulls) to the Axelarscan-UI repo.


## Example

In the example, you can see the Axelar Governance Address being added, this was the address referenced in the above image.

```
export default [
  {
    address: 'axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj',
    name: 'Axelar Governance',
    image: '/logos/accounts/axelarnet.svg',
  }
]
```


In this example no `environnment` was set meaning that this address will appear on both [mainnet](https://axelarscan.io/account/axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj) and [testnet](https://testnet.axelarscan.io/account/axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj).

If the address only needs to be included on mainnet then you would add the following 

```
export default [
  {
    address: 'axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj',
    name: 'Axelar Governance',
    image: '/logos/accounts/axelarnet.svg',
    environnment: 'mainnet'
  }
]
```
