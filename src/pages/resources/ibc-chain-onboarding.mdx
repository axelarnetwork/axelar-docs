# Onboard your IBC-compatible chain

Follow these steps to onboard your Cosmos or IBC-compatible chain to the Axelar network.

## Complete the connection request form

Fill out the designated [Cosmos Chain Connection Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18as2Dn7mrcxoic1K4UwnqnViU6QQx3cSuduHBVqYNCQ/edit#response=ACYDBNilAOeWdjJ8cnWODTkG-srrvfmGbwB3gMEw-dUo34OV26h8sA9uNk7_JHSE2U6GO9U). This form collects essential information about your chain and your team, which is important for a smooth integration process. Please ensure all provided information is accurate and complete.

## Create an IBC channel with prerequisites

Create an [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/3-ibc/) channel that meets the following prerequisites:

- **Auto-update by relayers** — Your IBC channel must be automatically updated by relayers every few hours (ideally every 2 to 3 hours). This ensures that the connection remains active and functional without manual intervention in the case of low transfer activity.
- **Trusting period for Axelar client** — Your Axelar client's trusting period should be set to **112 hours**. This duration corresponds to two-thirds of the unbonding period, aligning with security protocols.
- **Trusting period for your chain's IBC client** — Similarly, the trusting period for your chain’s IBC client should be set to exactly two-thirds of your chain's unbonding period. This is the recommended conservative configuration for trusting the IBC client state when the stake changes on the counterparty chain, accounting for potential downtimes.

### Highly recommended: use a relayer service

We strongly recommend partnering with a relayer to manage your IBC channel. A professional relayer can operate, update, and monitor your channel, ensuring its optimal performance and reliability. Utilizing a relayer service significantly reduces the risk of channel expiration and other potential issues.

## Configure your Keplr wallet

In the connection request form, provide the URL or necessary details where we can retrieve the Keplr wallet configuration.

## Transfer tokens

Once you submit the connection request form, we will provide an address for you to send tokens to. Sending tokens is necessary for testing the integration and ensuring that transactions can be successfully completed across the established IBC channel.

## Submit your chain’s logo

Please provide your chain's logo **in both PNG and SVG formats** in the connection request form. High-quality logos are essential for visibility and recognition across our platforms and interfaces.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or would like to report a bug, please file an issue in the [Axelar Developer Support repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support/issues). The Interop Labs team is available to assist you with any questions you may have along the way.
