# Pay Gas

An application that wants Axelar to automatically execute contract calls on the destination chain must do the following:

1. Estimate the `gasLimit` that the contract call will require in the executable contract on the destination chain.
1. Get the value of the source gas fee in the desired gas-payment token on the destination chain by [calling `estimateGasFee()`](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#estimategasfee).
    - `estimateGasFee()` will estimate the fee amount in the destination token,  convert it to the same price in the source token, and return that converted amount.
1. Pay the `AxelarGasService` smart contract on the source chain with `payNativeGasForContractCall()` or `payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken()`.

The [`AxelarGasService`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/ad37802dc6d62fff3ab589f2605f7a3e566977dd/contracts/interfaces/IAxelarGasService.sol) contract provides methods to pay gas for both `callContract()` and `callContractWithToken()`. Gas fees are paid in the native token of the source chain.

## Prerequisites

The [AxelarJS SDK](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/intro) must be installed.

## Pay gas fees to an `AxelarGasService` contract

The following is an example of how gas fees can be paid to an `AxelarGasService` contract. Assume that `SimpleTransferContract` is a smart contract deployed on a source chain:

```solidity
contract SimpleTransferContract {
  ...
  function sendToMany(
      string memory destinationChain,
      string memory destinationContractAddress,
      address[] calldata destinationAddresses,
      string memory symbol,
      uint256 amount
  ) external payable {
      address tokenAddress = gateway.tokenAddresses(symbol);
      IERC20(tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
      IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(address(gateway), amount);
      bytes memory payload = abi.encode(destinationAddresses);

      // msg.value is the gas amount paid to the contract.
      if(msg.value > 0) {
          // Pay the gas fee.
          gasReceiver.payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken{value: msg.value}(
              address(this),
              destinationChain,
              destinationContractAddress,
              payload,
              symbol,
              amount,
              msg.sender
          );
      }
      gateway.callContractWithToken(destinationChain, destinationContractAddress, payload, symbol, amount);
  }
}
```

`msg.value` is the gas amount paid to the `AxelarGasService` contract. Thus, the value returned from a call to `estimateGasFee()` must be passed to `msg.value` on the front end:

```solidity
await contract.sendToMany("moonbeam", "0x...", ["0x.."], "USDC", 1, {
  value: sourceGasFee, // Value returned from calling estimateGasFee()
});
```

After sending a transaction out, Axelarâ€™s Gas Service will do the following:

- Monitor `AxelarGasReceiver` for receipt of payment and get the amount paid as `amountPaid`.
- Match the gas paid to the correct contract calls.
- Submit the transaction to the Axelar network for confirmation.
- Execute the contract call with the `gasLimit` specified by the application.

## Alternative gas payment methods

See the [`AxelarGasService` interface](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/ad37802dc6d62fff3ab589f2605f7a3e566977dd/contracts/interfaces/IAxelarGasService.sol) for alternative gas payment methods.

When passing in arguments for these methods:

- `sender` must match the address that calls `callContract()` or `callContractWithToken()` on the `AxelarGateway`. If the `AxelarGasReceiver` is called by the same contract that will call the Gateway, specify `address(this)` as `sender`.
- `refundAddress` is the address that will eventually be able to [receive the excess amount paid for gas](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/gas-services/refund). Refunds are made on the source chain.

**`payNativeGasForContractCall()`**

For `payNativeGasForContractCall()`, the following must match the arguments of a `contractCall()` on the `AxelarGateway`:

- `destinationChain`
- `destinationAddress`
- `payload`

`msg.value` specifies the amount of funds received.

**`payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken()`**

For `payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken()`, the following must match the arguments of a `contractCallWithToken()` on the `AxelarGateway`:

- `destinationChain`
- `destinationAddress`
- `payload`
- `symbol`
- `amount`

`msg.value` specifies the amount of funds received.
