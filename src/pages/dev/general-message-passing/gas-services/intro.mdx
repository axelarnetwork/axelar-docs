# Introduction to the `AxelarGasService` contract

[`AxelarGasService`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IAxelarGasService.sol) is a smart contract that manages gas payments and refunds for cross-chain communication on the Axelar network. It allows an application to prepay gas fees on the source chain and increase the gas paid for a transaction. If too much gas is paid for a transaction, it can calculate and refund the sender.

## Prepay gas on the source chain

The Axelar network routes every [General Message Passing (GMP)](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/overview) transaction to its destination chain. The final step of this process involves the application paying the gas fees for the transaction. This can be done in one of two ways:

1. **On the destination chain:** Manually paid on the destination chain
1. **On the source chain:** Prepaid to the `AxelarGasService` contract on the source chain, thus allowing a relayer to execute the final transaction on the destination chain

Typically, gas fees are manually paid on the destination chain, but Axelar’s gas services provide the ability to prepay the full estimated cost for any GMP transaction with a single payment on the source chain. Axelar’s relay services manage the full pipeline. Once gas is paid to the Gas Receiver contract, the relayer services pick up the payment and automatically execute the final GMP call on the destination chain.

## Increase gas

If the amount of prepaid gas is not enough — for example, if the destination chain is congested with transfers, causing a gas fee increase for each transaction — the application can resubmit a new amount of gas to pay for the transaction.

## The Executor Service

The Executor Service is an optional relayer which observes and automatically uses the amount of gas paid to the Gas Service contract to relay the GMP message to the destination contract. Users are required to pay gas to the `AxelarGasService` contract to activate the Executor Service.

### Gas refunds

After the message has been relayed to the destination contract, Axelar will calculate and refund any extra gas fees to the payer account. This execution can be [monitored on Axelarscan or requested through the AxelarJS SDK](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/monitoring).

### Two-way calls

The Executor Service supports relaying two-way calls, when a message is sent from the source chain and another message is returned from the destination chain.

- **Outbound call:** a GMP call from chain A to chain B
- **Return call:** a GMP call returned from chain B to chain A

Once the outbound call is executed on chain B and sends another call to return a message to chain A, the Executor Service will automatically pay the gas for the return transaction.

If the remaining gas amount is insufficient for the return trip, the [**Insufficient Fee** tag](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/monitoring) will show up on Axelarscan. The return call will not be relayed until more gas is added via [Axelarscan](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/recovery#increase-gas-payment-to-the-gas-receiver-on-the-source-chain) or the [AxelarJS SDK](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/tx-status-query-recovery#2-increase-gas-payment).

### Sending messages from a single transaction to multiple destination chains 

The Executor Service also supports relaying multiple message calls from a single transaction. To do this, the application must pay the `GasReceiver` contract a separate gas fee for each message. The following message call is an example transaction where this occurs.
