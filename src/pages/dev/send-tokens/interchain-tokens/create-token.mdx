# Create a new Interchain Token

Interchain Tokens are ERC-20 tokens that are available on [multiple blockchains](https://docs.axelar.dev/resources/testnet). They are created using the [Interchain Token Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol) and can be used to transfer value between blockchains.

The Interchain Token Service is deployed to `0xB5FB4BE02232B1bBA4dC8f81dc24C26980dE9e3C` while the Interchain Token Factory is deployed to `0x83a93500d23Fbc3e82B410aD07A6a9F7A0670D66`

Let's explore two methods to create new Interchain Token(s).

## Create a new Interchain Token(s) using the Interchain Token Portal

The simplest type of Interchain Token is to create a brand new [Interchain Token](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol) available on multiple chains. For a detailed guide on how to create an Interchain Token using the Interchain Token Portal, refer to the four-step tutorial provided [here](https://axelar.network/blog/how-to-create-an-interchain-token-with-axelar-in-4-steps).

- Visit the [Interchain Portal](https://testnet.interchain.axelar.dev)
- Connect your wallet to the portal
- Select a source network where you have funds available
- Choose the option to deploy a new Interchain token
- Add the required details for your new token
    - Name
    - Symbol
    - Decimals
    - Amount to mint
- You can also click the advanced option where you can add an account as `Token Minter` and `Salt` value; otherwise, it gets prefilled with the deployer(connected account) address and a random, uniquely generated salt value
- Select additional chains for your token's availability and optionally add the token amount to mint on each selected chain

**Congratulations!** Your Interchain Token is now accessible on multiple blockchain networks. This allows for seamless interaction with your token on any of these networks, utilizing familiar methods like send, transfer, and approve, just as with any standard ERC-20 token.

Furthermore, your token follows the [Interchain Token Standard](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenStandard.sol). This means that users can call the `interchainTransfer` method on the token itself to transfer between blockchains.

Here is an example of the `interchainTransfer` method.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Initiates an interchain transfer of a specified token to a destination chain.
 * @dev The function retrieves the TokenManager associated with the tokenId.
 * @param tokenId The unique identifier of the token to be transferred.
 * @param destinationChain The destination chain to send the tokens to.
 * @param destinationAddress The address on the destination chain to send the tokens to.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens to be transferred.
 * @param metadata Optional metadata for the call for additional effects (such as calling a destination contract).
 */
function interchainTransfer(
    bytes32 tokenId,
    string calldata destinationChain,
    bytes calldata destinationAddress,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata metadata,
    uint256 gasValue
) external payable
```

## Create a custom Interchain Token(s)

If you want more features than the Interchain Token provides, you can create a [custom](../../reference/glossary/#custom-token) token. You may want a customized token to customize specific minting policies, ownership structures, rate limits, or other bespoke functionalities.

To create a custom Interchain Token:

- Build your [ERC-20](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-erc-20-token-4-steps) token and deploy it on multiple chains
- Deploy a [Mint/Burn](../../reference/glossary/#mintburn) - [Token Manager](../../reference/glossary/#token-manager) for existing tokens on all chains using [`deployTokenManager`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9edc4318ac1c17231e65886eea72c0f55469d7e5/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L276) on Interchain Token Service. The `deployTokenManager` method requires parameters like `salt`, `destinationChain`, `tokenManagerType`, `params`, and `gasValue`
- Make sure the Interchain Token Service can call the mint/burn on the token and repeat the step above for other chains where the token exists using the same deployer address and salt

Here is an example of deploying a token manager:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Used to deploy TokenManagers.
 * @dev At least the `gasValue` amount of native token must be passed to the function call. `gasValue` exists because this function can be
 * part of a multicall involving multiple functions that could make remote contract calls.
 * @param salt The salt to be used during deployment.
 * @param destinationChain The name of the chain to deploy the TokenManager and standardized token to.
 * @param tokenManagerType The type of TokenManager to be deployed.
 * @param params The params that will be used to initialize the TokenManager.
 * @param gasValue The amount of native tokens to be used to pay for gas for the remote deployment.
 * @return tokenId The tokenId corresponding to the deployed TokenManager.
 */
function deployTokenManager(
    bytes32 salt,
    string calldata destinationChain,
    TokenManagerType tokenManagerType,
    bytes calldata params,
    uint256 gasValue
) external payable 
```

To transfer tokens between chains, you can do that directly via the Interchain Token Service by calling the [`interchainTransfer`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v1.0.0/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenService.sol#L202). 

Tokens can move between chains seamlessly as the Token Manager contracts will mint and burn tokens as needed. If the `minter` parameter is empty bytes when deploying a new Interchain Token, then a `mint/burn` TokenManager is used; otherwise, a `lock/unlock` TokenManager is used. If you want to change the token minter to another address, you can do that using the `transferMintership` on the token.


>**Note**: If you want to build your token with the `IInterchainToken` feature yourself, make sure your token implements the [`IInterchainTokenStandard`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v1.0.0/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenStandard.sol) interface so you can offer [`interchainTransfer`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9edc4318ac1c17231e65886eea72c0f55469d7e5/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenStandard.sol#L19) and [`interchainTransferFrom`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9edc4318ac1c17231e65886eea72c0f55469d7e5/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenStandard.sol#L36) methods directly on your token. 

You can try our [sample custom token](https://remix.ethereum.org/axelarnetwork/axelar-docs/blob/main/public/samples/interchain-token-iinterchaintoken.sol) as a starting point. This token self-registers with the Interchain Token Service and can be deployed to multiple chains. 
Once you have designed your token, you can deploy it to multiple chains using a tool such as the [Constant Address Deployer](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/solidity-utilities#constant-address-deployer) to give it the same address everywhere.
