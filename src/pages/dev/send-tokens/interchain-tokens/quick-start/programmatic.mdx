## Interchain Token

[Interchain Tokens](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainToken.sol) are tokens [deployed](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L327) via ITS itself. These are relatively simple ERC20s with a built in integration to ITS so that they are bridgeable to other blockchains they are wired up to as soon as the token is deployed.

## Custom Token

Custom tokens are tokens that are deployed on their own as opposed to tokens deployed via ITS itself. Once integrated with ITS across different chains, custom tokens will become bridgeable between different blockchains.


### Integrate a custom token with ITS
1. Install the [Axelar ITS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axelar-network/interchain-token-service) dependency
   ```bash
   npm i @axelar-network/interchain-token-service
   ```
   

1. [Build your ERC-20](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-erc-20-token-4-steps) token and deploy it on multiple chains. You can use a tool such as the [Create3 Deployer](/dev/solidity-utilities/#create3-deployer) to give it the same address everywhere.
    ```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";


    contract MyInterchainToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable {
        constructor(address initialOwner)
            ERC20("My Interchain Token", "ITS")
        {}

        function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyMinter {
            _mint(to, amount);
        }
    }
    ```
    This token is a very simple implementation of an ERC20 but it contains all the critical functionality that would be needed to integrate with ITS. Namely, the ability to `mint()` and `burn()` tokens as ITS will interact with those functions while bridging the tokens between chains.

    You also have the option to inherit from the the [InterchainTokenStandard](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interchain-token/InterchainTokenStandard.sol#L12) so that your token has cross-chain functionality built into the token itself such as the `interchainTransfer()` function.

1. Integrate the token with ITS by calling [`deployTokenManager()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9edc4318ac1c17231e65886eea72c0f55469d7e5/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol#L276). 
    ```solidity
    bytes32 interchainTokenId = s_its.deployTokenManager(
        0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefab, //SALT
        '', //Dest Chain
        ITokenManagerType.TokenManagerType.MINT_BURN, //Token Manager Type
        abi.encode(msg.sender.toBytes(), newTokenProxy), //Params
        0 //GasValue
    );
    ```
    When the Token Manager is created it will facilitate connections for your token with ITS. There are several different types of Token Managers that are available to you. More info on Token Manager's an integrating with them can be found in the [Token Manager](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/token-manager/) section

1.  Add the `minter` role to your token's Token Manager.
    ```solidity
    itsToken.transferMintership(newMinter);
    ```
    The [`transferMintership()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9223108211b977d9138fdd67d5b4a641fc35c18c/contracts/utils/Minter.sol#L31) on your token can be called to transfer the minter role to the Token Manager. The reason for this is when your token is bridged into a destination chain, the `msg.sender` of the `mint()` call will be the Token Manager.

1. Send an interchain transfer
    ```solidity
    its.interchainTransfer{value: msg.value}(
        interchainTokenId, //tokenId
        'ethereum',  //destinationChain
        address(1), //receiver address
        123, //amount        
        0x, //metadata
        msg.value //gasValue
    )
    ```
    The [`interchainTransfer()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9223108211b977d9138fdd67d5b4a641fc35c18c/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenService.sol#L210) sends a cross-chain transfer between chains via the Interchain Token Service.

<Callout emoji="🚨">
  The key used to deploy custom tokens (`deployTokenManager`) is critical for
  security. If that key is compromised, then that token can be compromised
  across multiple chains. * Interchain native tokens can only be deployed to
  more chains via the same deployer key, so that needs to be retained. * Tokens
  registered on ITS should be careful about giving mint/burn permissions to
  other contracts. For example, shared mint permission with the Polygon native
  bridge is not supported (the Polygon native bridge only looks for burns, which
  ITS uses, meaning it can allow duplicate sends).
