Interchain tokens are ERC-20 tokens that are available on multiple blockchains. They are created using the [Interchain Token Service](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol), a smart contract responsible for handling interchain transfers.

You can create a new Interchain Token through the [Interchain Portal](https://interchain.axelar.dev/), or by building a custom ERC-20 token and deploying it to desired chains with a Mint/Burn token manager. These tokens will be accessible on multiple chains, facilitating seamless interaction on each chain by utilizing familiar methods such as send, transfer, and approve — just as with any standard ERC-20 token.

  Make sure you consider all relevant stakeholders before deploying a token
  through ITS. Creating a simple token using the ITS Portal will give the token
  the same name and symbol on all chains. If you need your token to have
  different names or symbols on different chains, you’ll have to build a custom
  token.

## Create a new Interchain Token using the Interchain Token Portal

The simplest way to create an Interchain Token is to do so through the Interchain Token Portal on either the [testnet](https://testnet.interchain.axelar.dev/) or the [mainnet](https://interchain.axelar.dev/).

1. Connect your wallet.
1. Select a source network where you have funds available.
1. Click **Deploy a new Interchain Token**.
1. Add your new token’s name, symbol, decimals, and amount to mint. You can also mark the token as mintable, which will allow the token minter to mint new tokens.  
1. Select additional chains for your token’s availability. You can optionally add the token amount to mint on each selected chain.

If your connected wallet has enough funds, your new token will become available on each chain you selected. It will follow the [Interchain Token Standard](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenStandard.sol), so users can call the [`interchainTransfer()`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/9223108211b977d9138fdd67d5b4a641fc35c18c/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainTokenService.sol#L210) method on the token itself to transfer between blockchains.
