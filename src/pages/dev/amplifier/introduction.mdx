# Introduction to the Interchain Amplifier

The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.

Until today, Axelar has enabled blockchain-to-blockchain communication with connections primarily to EVM-compatible and Cosmos-based blockchain ecosystems. The Interchain Amplifier takes a big step further, enabling generalized connections not only blockchains driven by other consensus engines, but traditional off-chain systems as well.

The Interchain Amplifier is a set of capabilities that enable integrators to easily connect chains and off-chain capabilities to the Axelar network. Developers can then seamlessly build applications that take advantage of these chains and capabilities.

Integrators gain access to Axelar's interconnected network of chains and can "amplify" their resources by paying the cost equivalent to developing only one connection. They can establish connections between new ecosystems or existing chains to add new network properties, such as improved security or better delivery and availability.

The Amplifier consists of the following, all on the Axelar network:

- An on-chain message router
- Gateways
- CosmWasm methods for receiving and sending messages

To connect to the Amplifier, integrators should:

- Implement and deploy a Gateway to the Axelar Network
- Work with verfiers to vote, prove, and attest to message validity
- Provide relaying infrastructure to identify incoming messages and act on outgoing messages

## GMP message Flow

To work with Amplifier integrations, developers use Axelarâ€™s [General Message Passing (GMP)](/dev/general-message-passing/overview) to exchange messages with other chains via either the Amplifier router or capabilities at the smart contract layer on Axelar.

Messages with Amplifier will take the following path:
