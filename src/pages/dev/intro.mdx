# Axelar for Developers

Axelar enables secure token transfers and communication across different blockchains, regardless of consensus mechanisms or message payloads. It’s based on the same [proof-of-stake security model](/learn/security#proof-of-stake-consensus) as many of the chains it connects. Interchain apps built on Axelar are truly permissionless: their transactions cannot be censored by any oracle, relayer, or validator.

To make an interchain transaction with Axelar:

1. Call the contract method on the source chain:
    * [`callContract()`](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-messages) to send messages without tokens, or
    * [`callContractWithToken()`](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-tokens-with-messages) to send messages along with ERC-20 tokens.
1. Pay gas to the [`AxelarGasService`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-solidity/blob/main/contracts/gas-service/AxelarGasService.sol) contract on the source chain.

You can then use [Axelarscan](/dev/intro#check-interchain-transactions), Axelar’s dedicated blockchain explorer, to execute, recover, or check the status of your transaction.

## Get started

### Create new cross-chain tokens

* [Create a new Interchain Token](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/create-token)
* [Upgrade existing ERC-20 tokens to Interchain Tokens](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/upgrade-tokens)

### Send tokens across chains

* [Send tokens between different blockchains](/dev/send-tokens/overview)
* [Rate limit for sending tokens across chains](/dev/send-tokens/interchain-tokens/rate-limit)

### Pass messages between chains

* [Call a smart contract on another chain](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-messages)
* [Call a smart contract on another chain and attach some tokens](/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-tokens-with-messages)

### Manage cross-chain gas payments

* [Transaction pricing with the Axelar Gas Service](/dev/gas-service/pricing)
* [Pay gas](/dev/gas-service/pay-gas)
* [Increase gas](/dev/gas-service/increase-gas)
* [Refund gas](/dev/gas-service/refund)

### Check interchain transactions

## Tools and resources

* [`axelar-examples`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples) – Cross-chain sample apps using Axelar that can be executed locally or deployed to testnets
* [`foundry-axelar-gmp-example`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/foundry-axelar-gmp-example) – A sample app that integrates with [Axelar GMP](/dev/general-message-passing/overview) using the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) framework
* [AxelarJS SDK](/dev/axelarjs-sdk/intro) – an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) library with a collection of APIs and query tools
* [`axelar-local-dev`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev) – A local cross-chain development environment where you can deploy an app to simulated EVM chains. These chains are preloaded with the [`AxelarGateway`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-solidity/blob/main/contracts/AxelarGateway.sol), `AxelarGasReceiver`, and routed ERC-20 (axlUSDC) token contracts. Deployed apps can be tested against the RPC endpoints and contract addresses of your local development environment.
