# Become an Amplifier Verifier (Worker)

The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.

By running a **verifier** (also called a **worker**) for a chain integration with Axelar, you will be responsible for voting on the validity of transactions on the Axelar network and signing command batches for a given chain.

## Prerequisites

1. Run `tofnd`. [`ampd`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/tree/main/ampd#worker-onboarding), the off-chain daemon responsible for voting and signing with the amplifier protocol, needs access to a running `tofnd` instance in order to onboard as a worker or run the daemon. See the [tofnd repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd) for more info.

2. Download `ampd` through either the [binary](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v0.1.0) or [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/axelarnet/axelar-ampd).

3. Create a `config.toml` file and put it in your `~/.ampd/` directory. 

By default, `ampd` loads the `config` file from `~/.ampd/config.toml` when running any command. This can be overridden by passing `--config [path]`.

See the [`ampd` README](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/ampd/README.md) on GitHub for instructions on formatting your `config` file.

## Verifier Onboarding

Prior to running the `ampd` daemon, workers will need to perform the following onboarding steps:

1. Determine the verifier address:

```bash
ampd worker-address
```

2. Fund the verifier address. This can be achieved in a number of ways and is dependent on the environment (mainnet, testnet or devnet).

For devnet:

1. Join the [Axelar Discord](https://discord.com/invite/axelar).
1. Get the Developer Role.
3. Go to the #faucet channel and submit a request with your account to get 100 test tokens.

```bash
!faucet devnet axelar1suw3fsckht00c5srgtr8p6lhn58e9lxq9yf5th
```

3. Bond the verifier:

```bash
ampd bond-worker [service name] [amount] [denom]
```

Bonded verifiers will stay bonded until they unbond or are removed by governance.

4. Register your public key:

```bash
ampd register-public-key
```

5. Register support for desired chains, enabling `ampd` to participate in voting and signing for the specified chains:

```bash
ampd register-chain-support [service name] [chains]...
```

Multiple chain names can be passed, separated by a space.

6. Authorize your verifier. 

This is dependent on the environment, and can be done via governance, or by the network operators.

For devnet, create an issue on [Axelar Support](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support) ask your address to be whitelisted.

## Run the daemon

The `ampd` command will run the daemon. A state file will be created if it doesn't yet exist. Its default location is `~/.ampd/state.json`, which can be overridden by passing:

```bash
--state [path]
```

## Productionizing

You should now switch to running your own full Axelar node and your own full node for any chains you are voting on.

## Help

For more info about the available commands and options, run:

```bash
ampd --help
```
