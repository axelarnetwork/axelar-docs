# Become an Amplifier Verifier

import { Callout } from "/src/components/callout"

<Callout>
The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.
</Callout>

By running a **verifier** for a chain integration with Axelar's Amplifier, you will be responsible for voting on the validity of transactions on the Axelar network and signing command batches for a given chain.

## `tofnd` and `ampd`

A verifier uses `ampd`, an off-chain daemon responsible for voting and signing with the Amplifier protocol, and `tofnd`, a threshold cryptography library that `ampd` depends on.

There are three ways to set up and run a verifier:

- **Option 1: Source** -- Clone and build directly from the GitHub source code.
- **Option 2: Binaries** -- This method requires you to install and run the `tofnd` and `ampd` binaries on your local machine.
- **Option 3: Docker** -- Use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to set up `tofnd` and `ampd`.

## Set up `tofnd`

`ampd` needs access to a locally running `tofnd` instance in order to onboard as a verifier or run the daemon. See the [tofnd repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd) for more information.

## Add `ampd` to your `PATH`

This will allow you to begin commands with `ampd`. If you set up `ampd` through source or Docker, make sure to build a binary first.

1. Add a symbolic link named `ampd` to the `ampd` binary on your machine:

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s <BINARY NAME> /usr/local/bin/ampd
    ```

1. Run the following to add an alias called `ampd` to the binary:

    ```bash
    alias ampd=<BINARY PATH>
    ```

1. Make the binary executable:

    ```bash
    chmod a+x ./ampd-darwin-arm64-v0.4.0
    ```

1. Restart your terminal.

All instructions in this tutorial will assume you have a binary in your `PATH` named `ampd`. If you don't want to add `ampd` to your `PATH`, you can refer to the binary directly in every command in this tutorial, replacing `ampd` with the `ampd` version that corresponds with your machine.

For example, to determine the verifier address without the `ampd` alias on an Apple Silicon Mac, you would run:

```bash
~/ampd-darwin-arm64-v0.4.0 verifier-address
```

## Configure the verifier

Create an `ampd` configuration file at `~/.ampd/config.toml`.

This configuration file tells `ampd` how to connect to your local `tofnd`, how to talk to the devnet and the Amplifier smart contracts, and includes a default configuration for verifying transactions on the Avalanche testnet.

The following is an example `config.toml` file for the verifier devnet:

    ```toml
    tm_jsonrpc="http://devnet-verifiers.axelar.dev:26657"
    tm_grpc="tcp://devnet-verifiers.axelar.dev:9090"
    event_buffer_cap=1000

    [service_registry]
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar1qk00h5atutpsv900x202pxx42npjr9thg58dnqpa72f2p7m2luas9x8txw"

    [broadcast]
    batch_gas_limit="1000000"
    broadcast_interval="1s"
    chain_id="devnet-verifiers"
    gas_adjustment="2"
    gas_price="0.00005uverifiers"
    queue_cap="1000"
    tx_fetch_interval="600ms"
    tx_fetch_max_retries="10"

    [tofnd_config]
    batch_gas_limit="10000000"
    key_uid="axelar"
    party_uid="ampd"
    url="http://127.0.0.1:50051"

    [[handlers]]
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar15nczwuqh0zcu6syeqsc4td6dphql7n2p7cgkl9raz97z5s3zdjrsc8we9y"
    type="MultisigSigner"

    [[handlers]]
    chain_name="avalanche"
    chain_rpc_url="https://avalanche-fuji-c-chain-rpc.publicnode.com"
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar1elaymnd2epmfr498h2x9p2nezc4eklv95uv92u9csfs8wl75w7yqdc0h67"
    type="EvmMsgVerifier"

    ```

See the [`ampd` README](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/ampd/README.md) on GitHub for instructions on formatting a `config` file for your own projects.

You can choose a different location for `config.toml` and refer to your chosen location rather than to `~/.ampd` in `ampd` commands. For example, if you saved your the config file in `/home/me/`, you would run:

```bash
ampd -config /home/me/devnet-verifiers.toml
```

<Callout>
If you get a transport error with an `ampd` command, make sure that you have `tofnd` running in the background.
</Callout>

## Fund your wallet

Prior to running the `ampd` daemon, you will need to set up your wallet with devnet funds.

1. Determine your verifier address:

    ```bash
    ampd verifier-address
    ```

    <Callout>
    If you get a security warning while trying to run `ampd` on an Apple Silicon Mac, you can disable the [gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/web) for a single binary with `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./ampd-darwin-arm64-v0.4.0` or disable gatekeeper globally with `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
    </Callout>

1. Fund your verifier address.

    1. Join the [Axelar Discord](https://discord.com/invite/axelar).
    1. Get the Developer Role.
    1. Go to the [#faucet channel](https://discord.com/channels/770814806105128977/1002423218772136056/1217885883152334918) and submit a request with your account to get 100 test tokens:

        ```bash
        !faucet devnet-verifiers [my verifier address]
        ```

## Activate and run the verifier

1. Bond your verifier:

    ```bash
    ampd bond-verifier validators 100 uverifiers
    ```

    Bonded verifiers will stay bonded until they unbond or are removed by governance.

1. Register your public key:

    ```bash
    ampd register-public-key
    ```

1. Register support for desired chains, enabling `ampd` to participate in voting and signing for the specified chains. As our configuration only supports Avalanche, the command is:

    ```bash
    ampd register-chain-support validators avalanche
    ```

    Multiple chain names can be passed, separated by a space (`ampd register-chain-support [service name] [chains]...`). Note that any chain you want to support here must be configured in your ampd `config.toml` file.

1. Authorize your verifier.

    This is dependent on the environment, and can be done via governance, or by the network operators.

    For devnet, fill out the [Amplifier Verifier Onboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQQhk292yT9j8sJF5ARRIE8PpI3LjuFc8rr7xZW7posSLtJA/viewform) for your address to be whitelisted.

1. Run the `ampd` daemon.

    Running `ampd` without any command will run the daemon. A state file will be created if it doesn't yet exist. Its default location is `~/.ampd/state.json`, which can be overridden by passing `--state [path]`.

## Productionizing

As you move towards testnet and mainnet, you should switch to running your own full Axelar node and your own full node or light client for any chains you are voting on.

## Help

For more info about the available commands and options, run:

```bash
