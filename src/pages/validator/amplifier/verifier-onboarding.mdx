# Become an Amplifier Verifier

<Callout>
The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.
</Callout>

By running a **verifier** for a chain integration with Axelar, you will be responsible for voting on the validity of transactions on the Axelar network and signing command batches for a given chain.

## Prerequisites

1. Run `tofnd`. 

    If you do not have it, you can pull and run the latest with the following:

    ```bash
    docker pull axelarnet/tofnd:v0.10.1
    docker run -p 50051:50051 --env MNEMONIC_CMD=auto --env NOPASSWORD=true -v tofnd:/.tofnd axelarnet/tofnd:v0.10.1
    ```

1. Then, pull and run [`ampd`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/tree/main/ampd#worker-onboarding), the off-chain daemon responsible for voting and signing with the amplifier protocol, needs access to a running `tofnd` instance in order to onboard as a verifier or run the daemon. See the [tofnd repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd) for more info.

1. Download `ampd` through either the [binary](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v0.1.0) or [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/axelarnet/axelar-ampd).

    For docker, be sure to pull the `0.1.0` version and `amd64` platform specifically, i.e. `docker pull axelarnet/axelar-ampd:v0.1.0 --platform amd64`.

1. Create a `config.toml` file and put it in your `~/.ampd/` directory. 

    Example config.toml file for the verifier devnet:

    ```bash
    tm_jsonrpc="http://devnet-verifiers.axelar.dev:26657"
    tm_grpc="tcp://devnet-verifiers.axelar.dev:9090"
    event_buffer_cap=1000

    [service_registry]
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar1hrpna9v7vs3stzyd4z3xf00676kf78zpe2u5ksvljswn2vnjp3ystlgl4x"

    [broadcast]
    batch_gas_limit="1000000"
    broadcast_interval="1s"
    chain_id="devnet-verifiers"
    gas_adjustment="2"
    gas_price="0.00005uamplifier"
    queue_cap="1000"
    tx_fetch_interval="600ms"
    tx_fetch_max_retries="10"

    [tofnd_config]
    batch_gas_limit="10000000"
    key_uid="axelar"
    party_uid="ampd"
    url="http://127.0.0.1:50051"

    [[handlers]]
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar1ufs3tlq4umljk0qfe8k5ya0x6hpavn897u2cnf9k0en9jr7qarqqa9263g"
    type="MultisigSigner"

    [[handlers]]
    chain_name="avalanche"
    chain_rpc_url="https://avalanche-fuji-c-chain-rpc.publicnode.com"
    cosmwasm_contract="axelar1466nf3zuxpya8q9emxukd7vftaf6h4psr0a07srl5zw74zh84yjq4687qd"
    type="EvmMsgVerifier"
    ```

    By default, `ampd` loads the `config` file from `~/.ampd/config.toml` when running any command. This can be overridden by passing `--config [path]`.

    See the [`ampd` README](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/ampd/README.md) on GitHub for instructions on formatting your `config` file.

## Verifier Onboarding

Prior to running the `ampd` daemon, verifiers will need to perform the following onboarding steps:

1. Determine the verifier address:

    ```bash
    ampd worker-address
    ```

1. Fund the verifier address.

    For devnet:

    1. Join the [Axelar Discord](https://discord.com/invite/axelar).
    1. Get the Developer Role.
    1. Go to the #faucet channel and submit a request with your account to get 100 test tokens.


        ```bash
        !faucet devnet-verifiers axelar1suw3fsckht00c5srgtr8p6lhn58e9lxq9yf5th
        ```

1. Bond the verifier:

    ```bash
    ampd bond-worker [service name] [amount] [denom]
    ```


    For example:

    ```bash
    ampd bond-worker validators 100 uverifiers
    ```

    Bonded verifiers will stay bonded until they unbond or are removed by governance.

1. Register your public key:

    ```bash
    ampd register-public-key
    ```

1. Register support for desired chains, enabling `ampd` to participate in voting and signing for the specified chains:

    ```bash
    ampd register-chain-support [service name] [chains]...

    #e.g. ampd register-chain-support validators avalanche chainB chainC
    ```

    Multiple chain names can be passed, separated by a space. Note, any chain you want to support here must be configured in your ampd `config.toml` file. 

1. Authorize your verifier. 

    This is dependent on the environment, and can be done via governance, or by the network operators.

    For devnet, fill out the [Amplifier Verifier Onboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQQhk292yT9j8sJF5ARRIE8PpI3LjuFc8rr7xZW7posSLtJA/viewform) for your address to be whitelisted.

## Run the daemon

The `ampd` command will run the daemon. A state file will be created if it doesn't yet exist. Its default location is `~/.ampd/state.json`, which can be overridden by passing:

```bash
--state [path]
```

## Productionizing

You should now switch to running your own full Axelar node and your own full node for any chains you are voting on.

## Help

For more info about the available commands and options, run:

```bash
ampd --help
```

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or would like to report a bug, please file an issue in the [Axelar Developer Support repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support/issues).
