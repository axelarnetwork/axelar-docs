# Become an Amplifier Verifier

import { Callout } from "/src/components/callout"

<Callout>
The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.
</Callout>

By running a **verifier** for a chain integration with Axelar, you will be responsible for voting on the validity of transactions on the Axelar network and signing command batches for a given chain.

## Prerequisites

1. Run `tofnd`. 

    If you do not have it, you can pull and run the latest with the following:

    ```bash
    docker pull haiyizxx/tofnd:latest
    docker run -p 50051:50051 --env MNEMONIC_CMD=auto --env NOPASSWORD=true -v tofnd:/.tofnd haiyizxx/tofnd:latest
    ```

    If you get a security warning while trying to run `ampd` on Mac, you can:
        - Make the binary executable with `chmod a+x ./ampd-darwin-amd64-v0.1.0`
        - Disable the gatekeeper with `sudo spctl --master-disable`

1. Then, download and run [`ampd`](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/tree/main/ampd#worker-onboarding), the off-chain daemon responsible for voting and signing with the amplifier protocol. 

    We recommend downloading the `ampd` [binary](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v0.1.0) (Mac and Linux). All instructions in this tutorial will assume you have a binary in your `PATH` named `ampd`.

        - You can add the `ampd` binary to your path with `sudo ln -s binary-name-0.1.0 /usr/local/bin`.
        - Alternatively, you can set an alias with `alias ampd=/Users/USER/.ampd/bin/ampd-darwin-amd64-v0.1.0` and restart your terminal. 
    
    If you don't want to add it to your path, you can refer to the binary directly, such as `~/ampd-linux-amd64-v0.1.0 <command>`.

    You can also use [`ampd` from Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/axelarnet/axelar-ampd). Make sure you pull the `0.1.0` version and `amd64` platform specifically, i.e. `docker pull axelarnet/axelar-ampd:v0.1.0 --platform amd64`.

`ampd` needs access to a locally running `tofnd` instance in order to onboard as a verifier or run the daemon. See the [tofnd repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd) for more info.

1. Create a `~/.ampd/config.toml` file (or refer to your chosen location later in ampd commands such as `ampd -config /home/me/devnet-verifiers.toml`). This configuration file tells `ampd` how to connect to your local `tofnd`, how to talk to the devnet and the Amplifier smart contracts, and includes a default configuration for verifying transactions on the Avalanche testnet.

    The following is an example `config.toml` file for the verifier devnet:

    ```bash
    tm_jsonrpc="http://devnet-verifiers.axelar.dev:26657"
    tm_grpc="tcp://devnet-verifiers.axelar.dev:9090"
    event_buffer_cap=1000

    ```

See the [`ampd` README](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/ampd/README.md) on GitHub for instructions on formatting a `config` file for your own projects.

## Verifier Onboarding

Prior to running the `ampd` daemon, you will need to perform the following onboarding steps:

1. Determine your verifier address:

    ```bash
    ampd worker-address
    ```

1. Fund your verifier address.

    For devnet:

    1. Join the [Axelar Discord](https://discord.com/invite/axelar).
    1. Get the Developer Role.
    1. Go to the [#faucet channel](https://discord.com/channels/770814806105128977/1002423218772136056/1217885883152334918) and submit a request with your account to get 100 test tokens:

        ```bash
        !faucet devnet-verifiers [my verifier address]
        ```

1. Bond your verifier:

    ```bash
    ampd bond-worker validators 100 uverifiers
    ```

    Bonded verifiers will stay bonded until they unbond or are removed by governance.

1. Register your public key:

    ```bash
    ampd register-public-key
    ```

1. Register support for desired chains, enabling `ampd` to participate in voting and signing for the specified chains. As our configuration only supports Avalanche, the command is:

    ```bash
    ampd register-chain-support validators avalanche
    ```

    Multiple chain names can be passed, separated by a space (`ampd register-chain-support [service name] [chains]...`). Note, any chain you want to support here must be configured in your ampd `config.toml` file. 

1. Authorize your verifier. 

    This is dependent on the environment, and can be done via governance, or by the network operators.

    For devnet, fill out the [Amplifier Verifier Onboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQQhk292yT9j8sJF5ARRIE8PpI3LjuFc8rr7xZW7posSLtJA/viewform) for your address to be whitelisted.

## Run the `ampd` daemon

The `ampd` command will run the daemon. A state file will be created if it doesn't yet exist. Its default location is `~/.ampd/state.json`, which can be overridden by passing:

```bash
--state [path]
```

## Productionizing

You should now switch to running your own full Axelar node and your own full node for any chains you are voting on.

## Help

For more info about the available commands and options, run:

```bash
ampd --help
```

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or would like to report a bug, please file an issue in the [Axelar Developer Support repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support/issues).
